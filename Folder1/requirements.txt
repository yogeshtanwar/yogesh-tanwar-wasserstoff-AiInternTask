Explanation of Each Dependency:

FastAPI: The framework to build APIs.
Uvicorn: A lightning-fast ASGI server for running your FastAPI app.
PyPDF2: For extracting text from PDFs.
Transformers: To load and use transformer models for text summarization.
Pymongo: To interact with MongoDB, store and retrieve summaries or related data.
Scikit-learn: If you are using it for keyword extraction (e.g., TF-IDF).
NLTK: For additional natural language processing tasks.
