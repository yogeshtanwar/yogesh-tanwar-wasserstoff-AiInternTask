The state of Punjab (1), S. R. Das, C.J., again reaffirmed this approach . it is, however, contended that although one can look at the surrounding circumstances, it is not open to the Court to examine other laws on the subject . the court in judging the reasonableness of a law, will necessarily see, not only the surrounding circumstances but all contemporaneous legislation . if restriction is under one law but countervailing advantages are created by another law passed as part of the same legislative plan, the Court should not refuse to refuse . the existence of such other law is not difficult to establish . the Courts can take judicial notice of it . eor nsu, sugar mills Ltd., is a public general knowledge . andAnot/ur Court would take judicial notice, and may in a proper .v. case require to be informed by evidence as to what The U 0h India the effect of the legislation will be . it is often impossible to determine the effect without taking into account any other Act operating, or recently operating in the Province . d down in a case falling within ss. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act . the general proposition is equally applicable where the effect of the legislation on those governed by it has to be measured . the oontemporaneous legislation passed as part of a legislative plan can be ex11-mined was clearly laid down by the Privy Council in Pillai v. Muda­ nayake . in that case, the question was whether the ceylon Citizenship Act (18 of 1948) and the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act (48 of 1949) were valid, or were ultra vire under the first two Acts, the Indian Tamils were denied as a community, the right of franchise unless they came within the terms of the first Act . they were thus subjected to dis­ abilities and restrictions which were prohibited by (1) (1939) A.C. u7, 130 . (2) (1939), A.c. 468, 477. 8 (3) 959 S. C.J. 297, 299-301 the later Act intituled the Indian and Pakistani Residents and Another (Citizenship) Act (3 of 1949), under which the Indian v. Tamils and others were entitled to get themselves The Union °! if the impugned Citizenship Act were bad when it was passed, it could not be 'brought back to light' by the subsequent Act . their Lordships did not accept this argument and read the later Act with the previous . the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act, no. 3 of 1949, by which an Indian Ta.mil could by an application obtain citizenship by registra­tion and thus protect his descendants . it was suggested on behalf of tho appellant that this Act might itself be ultra vires as conferring a privilege upon Indian Tamils within the country . s. 29(2)(b) of the Constitution Order-in Council was inadmissible to rebut the inference that the legislature had intended to make Indian Tamils liable to dis>ilities . but their Lordships cannot accept this argument . if there was a legislative plan the plan must be looked at as a whole . ian Ta.mils from attaining citizenship provided that they were sufficiently connected with the island . it is not necessary to speculate as to the remedies of the sugar dealers if the Sugar Control Order or the notification were varied or abrogated . uate arrangements to recoup the sugar and Another industry for the loss which it might suffer in giving .y. the export quota was spread over the remaining sugar to be sold in the country . counsel for the petitioners contend that by fixing a ceiling there is no guarantee that the commodity will be sold at the ceiling price and not at a lower rate . ere not able to sell sugar at the controlled price, because the price was fixed too high . the mills were not able to sell their sugar at the controlled price . quota was fixed at 2! per cent of their total produced sugar . petitioners were able to sell more than a lakh of bags in eight months . the balance sheet produced by the S. P. B. Mills shows that they were unable to sell sugar at the controlled price . it is evident that thailand's thursday's sale of sugar has not been substantiated . e plea that the mills are unable to sell sugar at the controlled price is a mere sham . the correspondence in the first case clearly demonstrates that the Mills were The Lord K rislina devising one excuse or another to a void the liability

charging interest, and that interest should be waived before the docu­ ments would be retired . the restriction was not unreasonable, because arrangement was made to save the owners of the factories from loss . the export served the national interest by staqilising the sugar market so that the production of sugarcane niay be maintained at a rea,;onable level . tabilised national economy by earning foreign exchange was comparatively small . the loss itself was so small that not to amount to an unreasonable restriction . petitioners next challenge the Act to show there is infringement of fundamental rights . section 5 only permits the Central Government to fix the quota leviable from different factories . if the object and purpose of the Act is valid, there being no disadvantage to the owners ultimately . andAnother criticised on the ground that delivery of goods and v. paym.ent of the price should be concurrent conditions . if the Government ws buying sugar, the provisions of

The State of West ncngil I1na1n] a warrant of arrest was issued by the Additional District Magistrate on septmnber 19 . appellant was released on bail with a direction to a ppcnr . ilitra ftuthorized to filn a com plftint against the appellant . on :U'ehruary 2, 1953, a complaint was filed against him . the state of Vest Bengal preferred an ttppeal to the High Court . he was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. l,OOQ in default to suffer ri . the order of the Magistrate directing the release of the currency notes was set aside . the main submission made on hehalf of the appellant before 11s has been that the Additional l>istric:t Magister Jrnving took congnizance of the offonee on l'cpt.em her Hl, 1952, and as the provisions of s. 23(:l) of the For,ign Exc: the subsequent aut:horization hy the ltescrvc Bank on January 27, l!J53, and the filing of S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 97 the complaint on February 2,1953,could not make legal proceedings . it was also urged that the facts found did not attract the provisions of s. 19 of the Sea Cus­ toms Act (8 of 1878 customs frontier as defined by the Central Government the cur­ rency notes in question . it was also urged that explana­tion offered by the appellant was accepted by the trying Magistrate and the High Court should not have set aside the acquittal . customs officers falsely charged him with smuggling currency notes out of india without any permit . appellant had applied to the Reserve Bank of India at Calcutta for a permit and sent an a pplication for that purpose . the appellant failed to get the permit upto the last moment . he handed over the currency notes in question to the Customs Officers . the high court did not accept the appellant's version . it was urged that the appeal is before us on a certific­ ate apd . te found, it was open to the appellant to urge that he was entitled to question the findings of the High Court . it is true that the high court has taken a different view to that taken by the trying Magistrate . he has rejected the case of a man who handed over the currency notes in question to customs officers in the circumstances mentioned by him . the high court gave very good reasons for accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the circumstiinces in which the currency notes in question were recovered from the appellant when his person was searched . an important circumstance which might have supported the appelant's case, namely whether he had applied to the Reserve Bank of India for a per­sti­tion . mit to take out of India currency notes to the extent of Rs. 25,000 was considered by the High Court . it found that the Reserve Bank received no application from the appellant before September 7, 1952, nor had the Reserve bank granted the permission to take any currency notes . the application of the appellant bore the date September 2, 1952 . the high court thought there were grounds for suspecting that this applic­ ation was-antedated . inspector Mitra applied for a search warrant and a warrant i;if ar rest respectively against the appellant . he was released on bail by the police with a direction to appear before the court on Septem . the appellant had ample opportunity to concoct an application for a permit after September 7, 1952 . it is inconceivable that a person who was leav­ ing for Hong Kong would have applied on September 2, 1952, when he was actually to fly on September 7 . he would have antedate it getting Joshi to forward the same to the Reserve Bank . t would have so timed his arrival at Calcutta as would have enabled him to make the necessary enquiries from Joshi or the Reserve Bank . it is impossible to believe that the appellant had arrived at the dum Dum Aero­ drome without making any enquiry from him at least if the permit had been granted . it is an entirely unacceptable story which the appellant put forward . he waited up to the last moment at the aerodrome for the necessary permit . it is not uv!ikely that if h!i was a witness in his case . we have no reason to think that the High Court had erred in suspecting that the application to the Reserve Bank was antedated . on this finding it is apparent that the very foundation of the defence of the appellant is false . the state of west Bengal Imam was searched when customs formalities were gone through is deposed to by a number of witnesses holding responsible positions . Panna Lal Dey's evidence was accepted by the High Court and after having examined his evidence we are satisfied that his evidence was acceptable . we are satisfied that the finding of the High Court is the only view which could reasonably be taken in a case like this . the appellant had not taken the currency notes in question across any customs frontier as defined by the.Central Government . an attempt to take out the currency notes in question is an offence punishable under the Sea Customs Act . the foreign exchange regulation (Amendment) Act l!J52 came into force in 1952 . tlie facts found that the appellant attempted to take out of India the currency notes in question . he -had entered the customs enclosure and signed the declaration form . on his personal search he dropped his trousers on the ground . he was asked to pick up his trousers and wear them again . the appellant had his ticket to procf.led to Hong Kong by a plane . if the appellant had cleared himself from customs formalities all that•was left for him to do was to board the plane which would take him 011t of india . the act was clearly an attempt to carry the sum of Rs. 25,000, in currency notes out of India without a permit from the Reserve Bank . the act of the appellant, on the fact found, amounted merely to preparation 11.nd not an attempt . the main submission was directed towards establishing that the entire proceed: ings before the Additional District Magistrate and the trying Magistrat were without jurisdiction as cogniz­ ance of the offence had been taken on September 16, 1952 . t date no complaint in writing made by an officer authorised in that behalf by the Central Government or the Reserve Bank of India by a general or a special order . it is therefore necessary to'see, in the circum­ stances of the present case, on what date cognizance of the offence was taken . inspector Mitra was so authorized by the Reserve Bank tm September 11, 1952 . in pursuance of that authorization applied to the Additional District Magistrate for the issue of a search warrant . the search warrant is issued for the pur­ poses of conducting investigation under that Act . on September 16, Mitra applied for a warrant of arrest against the appellant . under s. 155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, no police officer shall investigate a non-cognizable offence without the order of a Magi­ strate of the first or second class having power to try such a case or commit the same for trial . inspector mitra's application definitely states that he in asking for permission to investigate . a police officer being permitted to investigate a non-cognizable offence may exercise the same powers in respect of the investigation as an officer in charge of a station may exercise in a cogniz­ able case . a search warrant and the word \" permitted \" contained t,herein we consider that he granted the sanction for investigation as asked for . the appellant appeared before the Additional District Magistrate on September 19, 1952 . he is to give bail of Rs. 50,000 with ten sureties of 5,000 each . on perusal of the police report the Magistrate allowed further time for investiga­tion until January 2, 1953 . on January 27, 1953, inspector Mitra had been authorized to file a complaint . a.

Issue search warrant\" I959 Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas v. the state of west Bengal Imam . the additional district Magistrate was not being asked to take cognizance of the offence . the petition requesting the Additional District cannot be regarded as orders which indidate that the Additional district Magistrate took cognizance of the offence . ad not himself the power to make an arrest having regard to the provi­ sions of s. 155(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure . in order to facilitate his investigation it was necessary for him to arrest the appellant . the appellant had appeared before the Magistrate on February 2, 1953 . the question of issuing summons to him did not arise . there was no legal bar to the Additional District Magistrate taking cogniz­ ance of the offence on February 2, 1953 . on that date Inspector Mitra's complaint was one which he was authorized to make by the Reserve Bank under s. 23(3)(b) of the Foreign •Exchange Regulation Act . the offence on September 16, 1952, is without S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 105 foundation . the orders passed by the Additional District Magistrate on sept 16, 1952 and setember 19, 1952 . the additional district magistrate would not be required to pass any further orders . if a complaint was filed, it would be the duty of the Additional district Magistrate to enquire if the co-accused was involved . mplaint had been filed with the requisite authority of the Reserve Bank . there would be no legal bar to the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence . le the complaint as required by s. 23 the Magistrate concerned would be prohibited from taking cognizance . in the present case, the complaint filed on February 2, was one which complied with the provisions of the ]foreign Exchange Regulation Act . west Bengal v. Abani Kumar Banerji was approved by this Court in the case of the state of uUar Pradesh (2) . ta.king cognizance has not been defiant . magistrate must have taken cognizance of any offence under section 190(l(a) Criminal Procedure Code . he must not only have applied his mind to the contents of the petition but muRt have done so for the purpose of proceeding . the magistrate applies his mind not for the purpose of proceeding under the subsequent sections of this Chapter, but for taking action of some . it is, however, argued that in Chari's case this Court was dealing with a matter which came under the Prevention of Corrupt. ion act is a prin­ ciple approved by Das Gupta, J. . it is impossible to define what is meant by taking cognizance of an offence . a Magistrate applies his mind for the purpose of proceeding under s. 200 nd subsequent sections of Chapter XVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure . in our opinion, the trial of the appellant was legal . e appool dismisses the decision . the eppool manager is also dismissed . he is also sacked as a result ."}

(India) Lid. v. JU Workmen Wanehoo . the appellant is the Graham Trading Co. (India) Ltd. (hereinafter called the company) there was a dispute between the company and its workmen about bonus . it was referred by the government of west Bengal by its order of December 17, 195:J: to the second lndust.rial Tribunal .  company ha:d paid one month's bonus invariably from 1940 to 1950 . in 1951 one month was paid in October and half a month was also paid in December . the company replied that payments in past years had been entirely ex gratia . oss in 1953 it was not possible to make any ex gratia payment that year . the workmen contended that the sole object of bonus was to meet puja expenses and that the payment of this bonus had become customary . the quest.ion was considered by the Industrial Tribunal from three aspects . it considered whether any bonus was payable for this year as profit bonus . however, it was also made clear that the payment was ex gratia . the :Full Bench formula evolved in the mill.Owners' Association, Bombay, v. The Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombanay . it came to the conclusion that there was no available surplus of profit to justify such bQnus . puja bonus could be awarded either as an implied term of employment . puja bonus could not be awarded in this case on the basis of an implied term of employment . the workmen went up in appeal to the labour Appellate Tribunal . the company granted one month's basic wages as customary puja bonus . the company's accounts showing loss were not reliable and there might even be a case for profit bonus; but eventually it granted it . puja is a special festival of particular importance in Bengal . it has become usual with many firms there to pay their employees bonus to meet special puja expenses . Disputes have arisen with respect to this bonus . the Industrial Tribunal adjudicated upon the dispute . it observed that Durga Puja was a national festival in Bengal . but it became traditional and customary to make presents to near and dear ones . in 'bengal for employers to make a monetary grant at the time of the pujas' the tribunal had been assured that there was no intention to discontinue it . puja bonus usually paid in Bengal is of two kinds . it is paid as an implied term of employment and not as a matter of tradition or custom . in the present case it has been pointed out by the company that payments which had been made in the past years from 1940 to 1952 could not be con­ sidered as based on an implied term of employment in the circumstances of this case . this contention, in our opinion, is correct . j Awards made by the Tribunals for the quarter ending March 1949', p. 116.

(India) Ltd. v. Its Workmen Wanchoo j. z 959 ThGraham Trading Co . (indi) 112 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] was made, would, however, make no difference in this regard . the proof of custom depends upon the effect of the relevant factors enumerated by us . the practice in the present case began in 1940 and was unbroken upto 1950 . it was adjudication in 1948 to which the company was a party . ny before industrial tribunal that some bonus was being paid and there was no intention to discontinue it and conse­ quently . the payment was continued from 1949 to 1951 . some of the workmen accepted the payment while others did not, because they were not satisfied with the amount being paid as advance of pay . even those who had not accepted the advance were allowed to draw the bonus . ent of bonus from 1940 to 1952, for if the chairman had not converted what was advance of pay into bonus in December 1952, the workmen might ha. ve raised the dispute even in tha.t year a.nd then S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 113 there would have been no break up to 1951 . there has been unbroken payment and the period has been sufficiently long to justify an inference the delay in payment is not in our opinion material in this case . one of the directors of the company, who appeared as a witness, stated that it was paid by the company to help its staff during pujas . ofits had been made, has also been satisfied, for the evidence is that payments were made in at least two years of loss . one month's basic wage is the quantum of bonus from 1940 right up to 1952 without any change . ar as the puja bonus is concerned has always remained uniform at one month's basic wage . but that does not detract from the inference to be drawn from the facts proved in this case . there is no reason to interfere with the order of the Appellate Tribunal . the appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed . tlie first appeared in this Court as a distinct issue . the parties have to bear their own costs ."}

Chakravarti and Das Gupta held that a person who had no assessable income was not placP-d under a duty to file a return . they held that the return could not be 'treated' as a s. 24(1) or even . 24(3) when filed in answer to a notice . p. 442 said: \"A return under sectio . n on 24(1) is a return filed by a person who decides for himself that he had an assessable income in the previous year and by filing (I) ( 1948) 16 I. T. R. II9 . o assessable income in the previous year is placed under no duty by a notice under section 24(1) to furnish a return . a person who thinks, rightly or wrongly, that he had no assessmentable income will furnish none . the opinion here expressed was criticised in the judgment under appeal . in the next case, the ruling explained what was really meant . it is not necessary to refer to the facts of that case . a return under section 24(1) would only be filed by a person who thought that he had a taxable income . the return in the case we were then conned to be a result of the taxable limit . 'it should be remembered', he observed . if filed belatedly under section 22(2), a return showing an income below the taxable limit could not be filed under section 24(3) . this left the matter somewhat ambiguous as to what was really meant . x959 referred to s. 22(1) of the Act as it stood prior to Th c . e ommsssioner the amendment of 1953, and observed that under that section a person was required to file a return only if ' Bombay his total income during the preceding year exceeded v. the maximum amount which was not chargeable to Ranchhoddas tax . the learned Judges concluded that it was a complete mistake to think that s. 22(3) provided for the filing of a voluntary return showing loss, at any time, before assessment . they opined that a return of taxable income contemplated the filing . if a person had suffered a loss, he had even .no right, to 'report' that loss . not showing such income was not a return at all in law . the Calcutta view really proceeds upon the wording of s. 22(1) . it lays down that the public notice requires only persons having an income above the taxable limit . a return showing income below the taxable limit can be made even in answer to a notice under s. 22(2) . there is no reason to think that a good return of a similar kind is no return at all . a person may show his income and the 124 SUPREME COUii'l' REPORTS [1960(1] '959 deductions and allowances . but it may be T'\" c . that on a correct processing his income may be found  om1niss1oner . of Incom•-tax, to be above the taxable limits . hm1t is exempted from tax, but the return in law is not a mere scrap of paper . it is a return, such as the assessee considers, repre­karsondas . 'is.is.sioner of lncorne-tnx' view was accepted by the Madras High Court . 'notice under section 34 is only necessary if at t.he end of the assessment year no return has been made by the assessee,' he said . no return of income was filed in the assessment year, nor was any notice served under s. 22(1) . a return in answer to that notice could be served under section 34 . it was filed on January 5, 1950 before assessment . it was open to him to hold that the amount noted in the footnote was really the assessee's income . the tax could be charged thereon . the assessee (I) (1948) 161.T.R. ug.

approver was a reliable witness were made . the state of Pmijab, [1957] S.C.R. 953, dis­ tinguished . the circumstances proved in the case corroborated the approver's evidence connecting the appellant wit . appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 12th September, 1956 of the Calcutta. high court in criminal appeal no. 19 of 1956 . the appellant was sentenced to imprison­ ment for life under s. 302 by the Sessions Judge of Birbhum . he agreed with the majority verdict of the jury that he was guilty . the appellant appealed to the High Court for a certificate to appeal to this Court which was refused . the present appeal is by special leave . a month before the date of occurrence the appellant had made a proposal to her that she should live with him which was rejected . the removal of Sibapada Hati would clear the way and improve his chance of gaining his favour . e approver and circumstantial evidence corroborated him in connecting or tending or connect the appellant with the murder of the deceased Sibapada Hati . unless there was a misdirection in the charge to the jury which occasioned a failure of justice the jury's verdict must prevail . the High Court was of the opinion that there was no misdirection in the Sessions Judge's charge to the jury . the Sessions judge charged the jury as follows . we are in agreement with the high court . the approver is a competent witness against an accused person . a conviction is not illegal, merely because it is based on approver's evidence . the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is strictly admissible . a conviction based on it alone is not illegal . the conviction is a legal conviction . corroboration has become a settled rule of prac­tice of universal application . it must be as to the crime and the identity of each one of the accused . evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony, which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect the accused with the crime . corroborative evidence, you should bear in mind, must be evidence which implicates the accused . the corrobor­ ation-need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime . corroboration must be such as to connept or indentify each of the accused with the offence . r.orroborate his previous statement, viz., the statements that have been made by him before you in this Court . he must exer­ cise careful discrimination and look at all the surrounding circumstances in order to arrive at a conclusion . the jury should have been told (1) in accordance with the decision of this Court in the case of Sarwan Singh v. the state of Punjab (1) that the approver's evidence has to satisfy a double test . it must show that he is a reliable witness and that his evidence receives sufficient corroboration, (2) that the evidence of an approver must be confirmed . the corrobor1.tion (1) (1957] S.C.R. 9S 17 I959 . nanendraNath Ghose v. the state of west Bengal Imam]] ought to consist in circumstances that affect the identity of the party accused . there was no real distinc­ tion between the case of the accused J agdish Gorain and the appellant . a similar corroboration of the approver's testimony acquitted the accused . it is true that in Sarwan Singh's case this Court had held, \"the appreciation of an approver’s evidence has to satisfy a double test\" if this test is satisfied the second test which remains to be applied is that the approver's evidence must receive sufficient corroboration . these observations were made in the special circumstances of the case which this Court was deciding . the approver's evidence has not been considered by the High Court . the evidence of the approved approver in the present case is so thoroughly discrepant that it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that it is a wholly unreliable witness. the approver's account against one of the accused persons was wholly discrepant . there was circumstantial evidence which raised an amount of suspicion against Gurdial Singh . it seems to us that if it was found that the account given by er is unreliable, that would not be enough to sustain his conviction . uld inevitably have led the court to scrutinise his evidence in respect of the other accused persons with greater caution . it is clear therefore that in the special circumstances of the case of Sarwan Singh the approver had been found to be a wholly unreliable witness . he must show that he is a reliable witness and that is the test common to all witnesses . sarawan Singh's case was regarded as tainted evidence as unreliable . he told the jury that although an approver's evidence is strictly admissible it was a settled rule of practice not to convict a person . the jury could not have been more clearly warned about the danger of acting on an approver's evidence . the jury were told not to convict the appellant unless his evidence had been substantially corroborated . nothing was suggested to us or to the high court in what respect the approver’s evidence was unreliable . the decision in Sarwan Singh's case can be distinguished in the present case . it was never suggested that the approver's evidnce in this case was entirely unreliable if his evidence was tested in the same way as any prosecution witness in a criminal trial . ry is vitiated because of the decision of this Court in Sarwa.n Singh's case . the court of criminal appeal in england came to the follow­ ing conclusion . n corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime . the test applicable to determine the nature and extent is the same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or wr . ithin that class of offences for which corro­ boration is required by statute . the language of the statute implicates the accused, \"compendiously in­ corporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of practice\" the nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged . nce is evidence which shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true . in the present case the jury had been clearly directed by the Sessions Judge that corroborative evidence muse the crime . t be evidence which implicates the accused, i.e., which confirms in some material particulars . the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused c.r. committed the crime is true . the' corroboration must be such a.s to connect or identify each of the accused with the offence . no serious objection can be taken to the manner in which the Sessions Judge directed, the jury . evidence whi9h connects or tends to connect an accused with the crime . it is the approver's evidence which is the direct evidence . there should be corroboration in material particulars . the 3rd submission made on behalf of the appellant was accepted by the jury . he had a motive for his immoral proposal to the deceased . on the 25th of may, 1955, he came to Lila's house . the appellant came to the house and asked the deceased to go for a walk with him . the deceased did so a little after sunset . 134 SUPREME COURT REPORTS . at the time that the deceased was stabbed by the appellant he had sustained an injury on the dorsum of his left palm . medical evidence established that the appelant had an almost healed up ulcer t inch in length on the left side of the palm at its posterior surface one inch belowthewrist joint . the deceased had not returned to the club-house . his mother Brojeswari and her uncle searched for him . the appellant and his two co-accused used to associate . d that he did not know anything about the deceased's whereabouts . the appellant replied that the deceased went with him upto the canal towards north of the village . but as he felt a headache he came away and it was not possible to give any news . the high court was of the opinion that these circumstances independent of the direct evidence of the approver would not be sufficient to induce any reasonable person to come to the conclusion that the appellant had committed the crime . the jury had to decide for themselves whether the above-mentioned circum­ stances would be sufficient . corroborative evidence were sufficient to satisfy S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 135 them that the approver's evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased was true . but the circumstances mentioned were not circumstances . the corroboration is in a very material particular connectin . the medical evidence does not show that the injury was on the dorsum of the left palm . the first injury is described as one on the left side of the palm at its posterior suction . the jury were entitled to accept this evidence as sufficient corroboration in a material particular connecting the appellant or. tending to connect him with the crime . the appellant's pretended ignorance of the whereabouts of the deceased that very night and his ultimate admission that he had ta.ken the deceased towards the no.1 crime . the jury could rely in coming to the conclusion that it connected or tended to connect . nantndra N allt Ghose v. the state of west Bengal Imam was a circumstance on which the jury could rely as inconsistent with his innocence . 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [19601] the crime and accordingly the approver's evidence . he appellant did commit the crime was true . he had been acquitted by the jury but no real distinction between his case and the case of the appellant is unsound . a jury may have made a distinction between the case of Jagdish Gorain and the appellant . a judge ruled that the evidence was sufficient to connect or tend to connect . the jury may have regarded the circumstances as insufficient corroboration to connect or tend to connect J agdish Gorain with the crime . in our opinion, it cannot be said with anygood reason ."}

HIRA, WORKS MANAGER, PAREL, BOMBAY ETC . these appeals by special leave arose from applications made by the respondents, who were employed as timekeepers in the tv . respondents claimed payment of overtime wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (4 of 1936) they were workers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act, 1948 (LXIII of 1948) and as such were entitled to overtime wages . the validity of the claim on both the grounds was disputed by the appellant . the authority under the Payment of Wages Act found that only four of the respondents could claim the status of workers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act . ted the alternative case made by the respondents and directed the appellant to file a statement showing the overtime wages due to each of the respondents . the authority was right in the view that fr took of s. 70 of the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, and its decision must be affirmed . ut the second part makes the relevant provisions of the Factories Act applicable to them . the non-obstante clause in the section shows that the employees in a factory are entitled to claim overtime wages as provided for by that Act . it is not correct that s. 4 of the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, has the effect of excluding the opera­ tion . s. 70 is intended to operate not withstanding the other provisions of the Act . the Act provides for overtime wages for employees in all establishments . Civil Appeals Nos. 131 to 304 of 1957 . Appeals by special leave from judgments and order dated October 19, 1955 and January 31, 1956 . special leave arises from several applications made against Mr. B. P. Hira, Works Manager, Central Rail­ way Workshop and Factory, Pa.rel, Bombay (hereafter called the appellant) all these applications were heard by the Payment of Wages Authority, Bombay . the main judgment has been delivered by the said Authority . it gives rise to civil appeal no. 131 of 1957 . decision in this appeal will govern the rest of the appeals in this group . respondent alleged that h had been employed in the factory called the Central Rail- B. P.Hir• way Workshop and Factory . he had not been paid overtime wages due to him from April 1, 1949, to September 30, 1954 . n filing the present application should be condoned because he had been in correspondence with the railway administration in regard to the sa.id payment of overtime wages since 1948 . his case was that he filed the present applic-ation soon thereafter and so the delay made by him in making the claim before the Authority should be appreciated . authority heard the parties on the question of delay . the delay only in re,s- pect of the claim for the period after may 1953 should be condoned . the appellant conceded that the respondent had not been given a. holiday within the three days prior to or the three da.ys subsequent to the Sundays on which he had worked . he alleged tha.t he wa.s a worker within the meaning of s. 2, sub-s. (1) of the said Factories Act (LXIII of 1948) der s 59 of the said Act was made by the respondent on two alternative grounds . he urged that even if he wa.s not a worker within the meaning of s. 2(1) . the respondent was not a worker under s. 2(1) of the ]'actories Act . the authority considered the evidence led before it in respect of all the repondents for overtime wages . timekeepers to maintain initial records of attendance of workshop staff . to prepare pay-sheets for them to maintain leave accounts, to dispose of final settle­ ment cases of said staff and maintain records for satistical information . timekeepers are workers within the mean­ing of s. 2(1) of the Factories Act . the Allthority was disposed to take the view that . having regard to the nature of the work, the work consists in preparing the progress time-sheets . the progress time­ keepers must be held to be persons employed in work incidental to, or connected with, the manufac­ turing process or the subject of the manufacturing process . timekeepers are employees of the workshop, but are not workers under the Factories Act . the authority then considered the respondent's z959 argument that even if he was not a worker under the Factories Act he neverthless entitled to claim v. the benefit of s. 59 of the said Act . the authority accepted this contention . - and held that, even a . respondent was not an . Ga1enaragadkar J. worker . the authority orslered that the respondents would be entitled fdr the period 19-5-1953 to 30-9-1954 to overtime wages at double the ordinary rate for the Sundays on which they worked . the appellant was directed to file a statement showing the overtime wages to which the respondents were entitled . the appellant has filed the present group of appeals by special leave . the first point which has been urged by the learned Attorney-General is that the Authority was in error in holding that the progress timekeepers are workers under s. 2(1) of the Factories Act . manufacturing pro­ cess means any process for making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, packing, oiling, washing, cleaning, breaking-up, demolishing or otherwise treating . y, whether for wages or not, or in cleaning any part of the machinery or premises used for manufacturing process . the authority has 142 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] z959 held that the said duties can be treated as incidental to, or connected with, the manufacturing process . it is the c. M. Pradhan correctness of this finding that is challenged by the apr . the timekeepers are not workers under s. 2 (1) . aaron miller: the authority was in error in holding that the timekeepings were not workers . his contention is that the expression \"incidental to, or connected with, the manufacturing process\" is wide enough . the final decision of the Authority is based on the view that the respondents would be entitled to overtime wages under s. 59 of the Factories Act even if they are not worker . he says that he is entitled to support the final order passed by the Authority . if the conclusion of the Authority on the scop_e and effect of the provisions of s. 70 of the Act is correct, then it would be unnecessary to consider whether the timekeepers are workers under the factories Act . there are three statutes which pro­ vide for the payment of extra . s. 71 (c) of the Indian Railways Act (IX of 1890) lays down that the exempted railway servant shall be pa.id for overtime at not less than one and a quarter times his ordinary rate of pay . this provision has been amended by Act 59of1956, which makes the rate for overtime one and one-half times the ordinary rate . the respondents' claim is for a period prior to I d b h B. P. Hir11 the date of the amendment . the respondents are railway servants c. M. Pradhlln under the said Act . section 59 of the Factories Act also deals with the question of extra. wages for overtime . it provides for the payment of wages in respect of overtime work at the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages . the ca.se is the third statute which makes a provision for the payment of extra wages for overtime work . s. 59 by itself would not be applicable to the respondents . sub-s. (2) provides for overtime at the rate of twice the ordinary rate of wages in respect of employees in a residential hotel, restaurant or eating-house . it is clear that this section does not apply to the respondents because they are employees in the a. factory . respondents' case is that by virtue of s. 70 of the Act the provisions of the Factories Act, B. P.HiY• are extended to the cases of all em- c. M. Pradhan ployees in factories, and so they are entitled to claim - wages for overtime under the said section of the Gajendragadkar J. Factorries Act . ll.ny repugnance between the provi­ sions of s. 70 and those of the Factories Act can pos­ sibly arise . the validity of the said section is not in dispute . the only point which calls for our decision is the construction . does s. 70 supplement the provisions of the Factories Act by extending them to all employees in factories like the respondents though they are not workers under the said Act? nsolidate and amend the law relating to the regulat.ion and conditions of work and employment in shops, commercial establishments, residential hotels, restaurants, eating-houses, theatres and other establishments . section 2, sub-ss. (3), (4) and 27) define respectivly the establishment, commer­cial establishment and shop . commercial establishment, residential hotel, restaurant, eating-house, theatre or other place of public amuse­ment are entertainment to which the Act applies . it would be noticed that the definition of establishment I959 B. 'P. Hira is very wide, and it does not purport to be exhaustive v. because it expressly empowers the State Government c. M. Pradhan to include within its purview by notification other establishments not specified in it . it is necessary at this stage to refer to the definition of \" factory \" under the Act . a factory as meaning any premises which is deemed to be factory under s. 85 of the said Act. ten or more workers are working, or were working on any day of the preceding twelve months . or (ii) whereon twenty or more employees are working . a manufacturing process is being carried on without the aid of power . include a mine subject to the opera­ tion of the Mines Act, 1952 (XXXV of 1952), or a railway running shed;\" ands. 85 confers authori'.y on the State Government to extend the definition of factory to other places subject to those requirements . it is common ground that the place where the respon­ dents are employed is a factory under s. 2(m) of the i'a heme of the Act deals separately with shops and commercial establishments (ch. III), n. P.Hfra residential hotels, restaurants and eating-houses . separate provisions are made to regulate Gajendragadkar J. these different establishments having regard to the special needs of each one . in chs. VI to IX, no other section of the Act deals with factories . the definition of \"com­ mercial establishment\" does not expressly exclude factory . it is plain that factory is treated by the Act as separate and distinct . e Act which apply to establishment are not intended to, and do not, apply to factories . it does not include factory for the purpos of the Act . the definition of \" establishmept\" is wide enough . the factory where the respondents are employed is not connected with, much less an inseparable adjunct of, any establishment . so this aca­ demic aspect of the matter which was incidentally posed before us by the learned Attorney-General needs not be pursued further in the present appeal . section 4 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act its provisions mentioned S.C.R. SUPREME COUR'l' REPORTS 147 in the third column of sch. II shall not apply to the establishments, employees and other persons men . thorises the c. M. Pradhan State Government to add to, omit or alter any entries in the said schedule in the manner indicated by it . it is urged that the establishment of any rail- way administration is mentioned as sr. no. 5 in sch. II . learned Attorney-General suggested s. 70 applies to factories . lt is obvious thats. 4 mentions and applies only to establishments . the establishments mentioned at sr. nos. 1 to 6 in col. 2 of sch. II are wider than and different from the establishment as defined by s. 2(8) . we do not think that this suggestion is well-founded . all the provisions of the Act are made inapplic­able to the establishments and offices enumerated at sr. nos. 1 to 6 including 6(a) to 6(k) the remaining sections not so specified would apply to them . if that is so, they must be and are establishments under s. 2(8) of the act . s. 2(8) empowers the State Government to include by B. P .Hira notification any office or institution within the defini­ c. M. Pradhan tion of establishment . so the inclusion of any such office in col. 2 of sch. II would make it Gajcndragadkar J. an establishment under the Act, and as such it would be governed by it subject of course to the correspond­ing all the offices, establishments and other institutions mentioned in col. 2 of sch. II are and must be held to be establishments under s. 2(8) . but even ifs. 4 is assumed to be applicable to establishments, it can be accepted . the plain object underlying s. 70 and its context emphatically point out that it is intended to operate independently of the other provisions of the Act and in that sense it stands apart from them . this aspect of the matter is clarified by the Legislature by laying down that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to apply to any persons employed in the factory . s. 70 provides that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to any person employed in or within the precincts of a factory . the factories Act shall, notwithstanding anything in the said Act, apply to such person. the Act contained no provision which in terms or expressly applies to any such person . but it has provided that no provision in the Act shall even by inference or fiction be deemed to apply to them . c. M. Pradhan's second part of the section extends the application of the Factories Act to said persons . it would have been possible for the Legislature to include in the present statute a.11 the relevant provisions of the Act . the said Act contalns the provision by which workers are defined under s. 2(1) . it necessarily involves the consequerue that the relevant provision applies only to workers as defined and not to employees in factories who are not workers . the non-obstante clause in s. 7 serves the purpose of clarifying the position thatthe Factories Act is made applicable to employees in factories . it has itself macb provision for the payment of overtime wages to empoyees in all establishments . in 01r opinion its validity or correctness is not open to doult . in the result the orders passed by the authority are confiomed and the appeals are dismissed ."}

J. and DAs JThe entire of the bihar land reforms Act of 1950 is unconstitutional . the Bihar Land Reforms Act, XXX of 1950, is not a law in respect of a matter mention­ ed in entry 18 of List II . the obligation to pay compensation for property acquired by the State is not an obligation imposed by entry 36 of List III . an objection to the validity of a statute in resixct of acquisition of property on the ground that it does not provide for payment of compen­ sation is an objection on the grounds that it contravenes the provisions of art. 31(2) . the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain such an objection is barred . tion to pay compensation is implicit in entry 36 of List II, in itself or read with entry 42 of List III . section 32(2) of the Act does not involve any delegation of legislative powers . the words \"subject to\" in entry 36 of List II only mean that when a law is made by a State Legislature in exercise of its legislative power under entry 42 of List III, that law will be subject to the provisions of the law made by the Parliament . gislature has itself provided that the compensation shall be payable in cash or in bonds . ate makes a law under entry 36 it must lay down the principles on which compensation payable for property acquired is to be determined . the power conferred thereunder on the legislatures is not coupled with any duty on the legislature to exercise . a public purpose as a pre-requisite to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition is an essential part of the provisions of art. 31(2) . an infringement of such a provision cannot be put forward . the necessity of a public purpose is implied in entry 36 of List II and/or entry 42 of List III also, arts. 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B would still protect the Act from be­ ing questioned on the ground that the acquisition was not for a . public purpose . ns of compensation contained in any law dealing with the acquisition of property compulsorily . art. 31 ( 4) do not debar the court from consider• ing whether the acquisition is for a public purpose . art. 31 (2) relates to everything that is provided for in art. 31, (2) . clause (b) is to deprive the man of his money, which is not a subject-matter for acquisition under the powers of eminent domain . the legislature has evaded and nullified its provi-sions altogether . sec. 4 clause (b) is therefore unconstitutional \"'' and void . law made under entry 36 of List II cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action . section 4 clause (b) is not therefore ultra vires or un- constitutional . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga . &xtion 23 (b) of the Act provides for a deduction on a percentage basis out of the gross asserts for \"costs of works of benefit to the raiyat\" is ostensibly enacted under entry 42 of List III, but it is merely a colourable piece of legislation, a mere device to reduce the gross assets . air the minor irrigation works in their villages which arc beneficial to the raiyats and the cost of such works is therefore a perfectly legitimate deduction in computing the net assets of the estate . a reduction which results in reducing the compensation is unwarrant . the phrase \"public purpose\" hao to be construed according to the spirit of the times in which the parti-cular legislation is enacted . acquisition of estates for the purpose of preventing the concentration of huge blocks of land in the hands of a few individuals is for a public purpose . ept has been rapidly changing in all countries, but it is clear that it is the presence of the element of general interest of the community in an object or an aim that transforms such object or aim into a public purpose . APPEALS under article 132(1) of the Constitution of India from the judgment and decree dated 12th March, 1951, of the High Court . a petition under. article 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of fundamental rights was also heard . the appeals were based on the facts that gave rise to these appeals and peti-; . ttdvad (Attorney-General for India) and Mahabir Prasad (Advocate-General. of Bihar) for the state of bihar . P. R. Das (B. Sen, with him), for the respondents in cases . s. 310, 311 and 329 of 1951 . appeals and peti-tions raise the issue of the constitutionality of the constitution . three enactments called the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXX of 1950) were valid . the Chief Justice, in his judgment, dealt with the above . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaia­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . 1952 The state of bihar was referred to as the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) and [1952] Proprietary Act, 1950 . the common aim of these statutes, generally speak- ing, is to abolish zamindaries and other proprietary estates and tenures in the three States aforesaid . they are to eliminate intermediaries by means of compul- sory acquisition of their rights and interests . the constitutionality of these Acts has been challenged . the Bihar Act was declared unconstitutional and void on the grounds that it contravened article 14 of the Constitution . the other two Acts were adjudged constitu- tional and valid . r consideration in all these appeals and petitions is whether the three state legislatures, whch respetively passed the three impugned statutes, were constitutiona.ly competent to enact them, though some special points are also involved in some of these cases . constitution by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 was passed by the provisional Parlia ment during the pendency of these proceedings . that Act by inserting the new articles 31-A and -.. ment . article 31-A shall be \"deemed always to have been inserted\" no statutes \"shall be deemed ever to have become void\" the validity of the Amend- ment Act was challenged in this court under article 32 . the impugned Acts can no longer be attacked on the ground of alleg- ed infringement of any of the rights conferred by the provisions of Part III . it will be noted that articles 31-A and 31-B afford only limited protection against one ground of challenge . the amendment Act pro- vides no immunity from attacks based on the lack of legislative competence under article 246 . the amendment act d!d not affect the Lists . zamin- dars counsel based his main argument in the amendment . se proceedings on entry 36 of List II and entry 42 of List III read as follows: \"36. Acquisition or requisitioning except for the purposes of the Union, Provisions of entry 42 in List III. of property, subject to the 42. Principles on which compensation for property acquired/requisiteed for the purpose of the union (1) [1952] S.C.R. 89. 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaj the argument may be summarised thus . entry 36 of List II read with article 246(3) was obviously in- tended to authorise a State Legislature to exercise the right of eminent domain . the exercise of such power has been recognised in the jurisprudence of all civilised countries . the existence of a public purpose and an obligation to pay compensation is thus the neces- sary concomitants of compulsory acquisitio . the term \"acquisition\" must be construed as importing, by necessary implication, the two conditions aforesaid . it is a recognised rule for the con- strued of statutes that, unless the words of the statute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be con-struid . the power to take compulsorily raises a right to payment . the words \"sub- ject to the provisions of entry 42 of List III\" in entry 36 reinforce the argument . these words must mean that the power to make a law with respect to acquisition of property should be exercised subject to the condition that such law should also provide for matters referred to in entry 4 2 . the legisla- tive power conferred under entry 42 is a power coupl with a duty to exercise it for the benefit of the owners whose properties are compulsorily acquired . the state legislatures, it was claimed, had no power to make a law for acquisition of property with- out fulfilling the t- . counsel examines various provisions of the im- pugned Acts . the principles laid down for the com- putation of compensation operated m reality as 'principles of confiscatat' the enactment of the statutes was in truth a \"fraud on the Constitu-tion\" each of them was a colourable legislative .expedient for taking private properties without pay of compensation in violation of the Constitution . they were enacted for any public pur pose . the politkal party in power is pur-suing a policy that could not be regarded as a public purpose . Mr. Somayya argued that the impugned Acts were not passed . counsel stressed the words \"law\" and •'legislature\" and submitted that, inasmuch as the legislature of a State included the Governor . 1952 The State of Bihar v . a bill could become a law only after the Governor assented to it under article 200 . clause (3) of article 31 must be taken to require that a State law authorising compulsory acquisition of property should rei;eive the Governor's as well as the President's approval . the statutes did not satisfy the require-, ments of article 31 (3) and so could not have effect . the ground of attack, it was claimed, was not exclud- 'ed by article 31-A or Article 31-B as it wasn't based on fundamental rights . entry 36 of List II or entry 42 of List III could not be taken, as a matter of construction, to import an obli- gation to pay compensation . but he maintained that a prohibition against compulsory acqui- ition of property without public n- n . ecessity and pay-ment of compensation was deducible from what he- called the \"spirit of the Constitution\" the constitution must be held to contain an implied prohibition against taking private  property without just compensation and in the absence of a public purpose . a constitutional prohibition can be derived by implication from the spirit of the Con- stitution where no exprs prohibtion has been enacted . npthing in the two articles aforesaid to preclude objection on the ground that the impugned Acts do not satisfy these requirements . the validity of each of them or of some specific provisions thereof was Aliso challenged on some special grounds . zemin- dars lost the battle in the last round when this Court upheld the constitutionality of the amendment Act which the Provisional Parliament enacted with the object of putting an end to this . no property movable or immovable ........ shall be acquired for public purposes under any law authorising such acquisition unless the law provides for co-authorisation . it will be convenient here to set out the material provisions of the Constitution . no such law shall have effect unless 3-10 S. C. India/71 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaia dhiraia Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhang_a and others . a bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the Legislature of a State has been reserved for the consideration of the President . the law so assented to the president has received his assent . (5) Nothing in clause (2) hall affect- (a) any existing law other than a law to which the provisions of clause (6) apply, or (b) any law which the State may hereafter make- (i) for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty . ny agreement entered into with respect to property declared by law to be evacuee property . notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provision; of this Part no law providing for the acquisition by the State of any e.state or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modifica-tion of a property therein . ny such rights, shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provi-sions of this Part . without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article 31-A none of the Acts and Regu- lations specified in the Ninth Schedule shall be considered void, or ever r to have become void . s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 901 Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part . each of the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent Legislature to repeal or amend it . article 31 ( 4) excludes attack only on the ground of contravention of article 31 (2) . article 31-A bars objections based on contraven-tion of other provisions of Part III . exclusions in article 31(4) were found inapt to cover objections based on contravention of article 14 . the law referred to m article 31,(4) covers acquisition of any kind of property, while article 31-A relates only to the acquisition of a parti- cular kind . a law which falls within the purview of article 31-A could only prevail over \"foregoing provisions of this Part\" the three impugned statutes are protected from attack in any court on the ground that they contravene the provisions of the article 31(2). 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaia dhiraia Sir Kameshwar1 Singh of darbhanga and others . clause (2) assumed but did not \"provide\" that acqms1t10n should be authorised only for a public purpose . clause seeks also to impose a limitation in regard to public purpose, he says . joint Parliamentary Committee recommends two conditions on expropriation of private property . \"we think it (the provision proposed) should secure that legisla- tion ex-propriating or authorising the expropriation of the property of private individuals should be lawful only if confined to public purpose and compernation, is determined either in the first instance or in appeal by some independent . th_at article 31 (2) was also intended to impose the same two conditions on legislation ex- propriating private property . it seems reasonable to conclude that section 299(2) was intended to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject to which legislation authorising expropriation of private property should be lawful . ul only if it was required for a public purpose and provision was made for pay- ment of compensation . it cannot be supposed that the framers of the Constitution left the other to be imported from tycoon . article 31 (2) must therefore be taken to provide for both the limitations in express terms . an attack on the ground that the law m question authorises acquisition without reference to a public purpose and without payment of compensation . counsel stoutly denied that they were relying on the provi-sions of article 31(2) . their main attack was really grounded on the absence of these two essential . requisites of valid legislation authorising acqms1t1on of private property . em by implication from entry 36 of List II and entry 42 of List III . david frum: the statutes are bad because of the absence of a public purpose and the omission to pro- vide for a just compensation . he says if these two grounds of attack fall within the purview of article 31 ( 4), the words \"notwithsta\" clause (4) of article 31 would - be meaningless surplusage . clause was specially designed to protect impugned stat- tion . article 31 ( 4) was 1952 The Stateof Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhang• and others . learneded counsel were unable to suggest any . the zemindars' contention was to prevail . article 31-A operates on the two fold ground of enactments . it was designed to bar the jurisdiction of courts to entertain objections . except10n to article 31 (2) read only in respect of laws authorising ac- quisition of \"estates\" and rights thdein . the exception is to be deemed to have been part of the Constitution from its commencement . peter bergen: the state's power of compulsory acquisition t'hus incor- porated in the body of the Constitution would be contrary to elementary canons of statutory con- struction . he says the state would read those very limita-tions into entry 36 of List II, alone or in conjunction with entry 42 of list III of the Seventh Schedule, or deduce them from \"the spirit of the constitution\" the common law of eminent domain is recognised in the jurisprudence of all civi- lized countries . the state cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required for a public purpose and without compensating the owner for its loss . there can be no room for implication, a law which takes away or abridges these safe- guards . \"acquisition of property\" must be understood in their natural sense of the act of acquiring property, without importing into the phrase an obligation to pay . the entries in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule are designed to define and delimit the respective areas of legislative competence of the Union and State Legislatures. the expression \"acquisition of property in entry 36 of list II does not carry any obli- gation to pay compensation\" clause (4) of that article postulates a \"law\" authorising acquisition of property but contravening clause (2) . clall!se (5) contemplates laws being made with- out a public purpose or payment of compensation . such laws can be made only under entry 36 which must, therefore, be taken to confer a legislative power . the sub-clause was inserted only by abundant caution . ruben navarrette: heads (2) and (3) of sub- clause (b) must necessarily be referable to, and derive their competence from the legislative power under entry 36 of List II . ce power of the state is only the general power to regulate and control the exercise of private rights and lioerties in the interests of the community . the state does not represent any specific head of legislative power . the words \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 in List III\" must mean that the law-making power under entry 36 could only be exercised subject to the two conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation . ion mean no more than that any law made under entry 36 by a State Legislature can be displaced or overridden by the Union Legislature making a law under entry 42 of List III . similar words do not occur in entry 33 of List I which confer on Parliament the power of making laws with respect to acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the Union . no reason was suggested why parliamentary legislation with respect to acquisition or requisitioning of property is to be free from such restrictive conC!i-tions . the law-making power of both Parlia- ment and State Legislatures can be exercised only subject to the aforementioned two restrictions . the fact is that laws falling under article 31 ( 4) or under articles 31-A and 31-B cannot be called in question for non-compliance with those pre>- visions . the power to make a law under entry 42 of List III was a power coupled with a duty, because such law was obviously intended . it was also bound to exercise the power of making law laying down the principles on which such owners should be compensated for their loss . may be granted in order to be exer- cised in favour of certain persons who are intended to be benefited by their exercise . power granted to a legislature to make a law with respect to any matter cannot be brought under thomas law . a bill passed by such legislature cannot become a law until it receives its approval . the legislature cannot be under an obligation to make law in exercise of that power . no obligation of that kind can be enforced against a legislative body . Article 200 contemplates one of three courses being adopted by the Governor . the first proviso deals with a situation where the Gover- nor is bound to give his !lssent . the article does not contemplate the (1) L.R. 5 H.L. 214 . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaia dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of /)arbhanga . the constitution would contemplate only \"bills\" passed by the House or Houses of Legislature being reserved for the consideration of the President . the governor is prohibited from giving his assent where such reser- vation by him is made compulsory . ne> hasty or unjust expropriatory legislation is passed by a state legislature . the term \"legislature\" is not always used in the Constitution as including the constitution . he is unable to agree with this view . the word is clearly used in the sense of the \"Houses of legislature\" and excludes the Governor . the word \"law\" is sometimes loosely used in referring to a bill . \"the law so assented to\" would mean \"passed by the legislature\" it would cease to be a \"bill\" and could no longer be reserved as such . the phrase obviouslv refers to what has become a law after recei- ving the assent of the president . if it was intended a such law would slam it as a h1w . hould have the assent of both the Governor and the President . he would expect to find a more clear or explicit provision to that effect . on the other hand, he is prohibited from giving his assent . it becomes unnecessary to consider what is a public purpose and whether the acquisition autho rised by the impugned statutes subserves any public purpose . it is not necessary to examine whether the scheme of compensation provided for by the statutes is so illusory as to leave the expropriated owners without any real compensation . a section 4(b) of the Bihar Act provides that all arrears of rent, royalti and cesses due for any period prior to the date of the vesting of the estates in Government \"shall vest and be recoverable by the State\" the government evidently lacked funds for the pa- cular cases . yment of even the illusory compensation provided for in the Act hit upon the device of acquiring these arrears on payment of only 50 per cent . gmenting the Treasury could not be regard- ed as a public purpose such as would justify expro-priation of private property . 'arrears' would represent so much money when realised . the argument proceeds on a misconception . it is not correct to say that a law made under entry 36 of List II cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action . nt in cash or in Government bonds of half the amount of such arrears leaves the zemindar without compensation for the balance . it is unrealistic to assume that arreares which had remained uncollected over a period of years . the zmindar as landlord had the advantage of summary remedies and other facilities for collection . e for doubtful and irrecoverable arrears and the trouble and expense involved in the collection of the rest of them must be considered reasonable and fair compensation for taking them over . the contention leaves one almost wondering what aavantage the zemindars would gain by seeking to overthrow a provision in the Act which may well prove beneficial to them . article 31(4) bars a challenge on these two grounds . the objections to section 4b cannot be entertained . section 23 (l)(f) provides for a deduction on a percentage basis out of the gross assets . the provision for such deduction was there-fore a fraud on the Constitution . the argument overlooks the well-established obligation of the zemindars to maintain and repair the irrigation tanks and channels in their estates . the zemandars have no power to do away with these tanks in the maintenance of which large numbers of people are interested . they are charged, under Indian law, by reason of their tenure, with the duty of pre- serving and repairing them . their cost is a perfectly legitimate deduction in computing the net assets of the estate . st, neglected this duty, that does not affect the propriety of the deduction . it is idle to say that it is a mere contrivance for reducing the compensation . if, as I have endeavoured to show, payment of compensation isi not a justiciable issue . the former pro-vision compensation was payable in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds . the bonds (1) (1874) 1 I.A. 364. 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Karneshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . the Constitution conferred power on the legislatures under entry 42 of Lissabeth . it was argued that, whik's constitutional powers conferred powers on legislatures . the constitution gave power to the state government under section 43 (2) . t III to make laws with respect to the principles on which compensa- tiop for property acquired was to be determined . it was not com- petent for the Bihar Legislature to delegate this essen-tial legislative power to the executive government . section 43 (2) (p) being thus void and inoperative, section 32 (2) must also fall to the ground . the legislature has fixed the number of equal instalments in which it should be paid . it has also provided for payment of interest on the compensation amount in the mean- time . the proportion in which the compensation could be paid in cash and in bonds . by no standard of permissible delegation can the vesting of such limited discretion by a legislature in an administrative body be held incompetent . the same remark applies to the delega-tion of rule-making powers in regard to payment of compensation undue . -S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 913 on the motion that it be passed into law, as required by the provisions of rule 20 (1) of the rules governing legislative business then in force . the omis-sion was not a mere \"irregularity of procedure\" which the court is barred from enquiring into under article 212 (1) . rule 20 (1) reads as fol- lows: \"A matter requiring the decision of the Assembly shall be decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member\" one of the ministers moved that \"the C.

[1945] was only intended to illustrate the application of the general words of the article . the opening words are intended to make clear that articles 31-A should not be restricted in its application by reason of anything contained in the article and are in no way calculated to restrict . the estates sought to be acquir- ed are situated in what was previously the territory of Indian States . the properties in question were recognised to be in question by the government of india . the \"private property\" of the Rulers was urged that estates sought to be acquired formed part of their \"per- sonal rights\" neither the impugned statutes nor notifications issued thereunder could deprive Ruler of such properties . there was no contravention of any guarantee or assurance given by the Government under the covenant of merger . the estates in question are sought to be acquired only as the \"private property\" of the Rulers . alleged that the privy purse of the Ruler was fixed at a low figure in consideration of the Oudh 4-10 S. c.

Mahara7a­ dhiraja Sir I.ameshwar Singh of darbhanga . the Act was unconstitutional as it contra- vened article 14 of the Constitution . the zamindars brought forward a bill to amend the Constitution and this was passed by the requisite majority . petitions were brought under article 32 of the Constitution impugning the Amendment Act itself as unconstitutional and void . the Constitu- tion (first amendment) Act, 1951, was validly enacted . rvive and the Act is not open to challenge on any such ground . the High Court has held the Act' invalid solely on the grounds it violated the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution . he supported the decision of the court on grounds that it contra- vened any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution . he urged the following points :-; -S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 919 . that the legislative power in various sections of the Act has been abdicated in favour of the executive and such abdication of power was unconstitutional . the foundation of Mr. P. R. Das's attack on the vires rests on the contention that it is implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of th . e Constitution that pro- perty could not be acquired without payment of compensation . the only effect of a compulsory power of acquisition against the individual is that there is the power to oblige him to sell and convey property when the public necessities require it . power to acquire is inseparable from the obligation to pay compen- ration . the provisions of the statute in respect of payment of compensation are illusory . it is said that it deals with the fundamental right regarding property which is expressed in the clause in negative language . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others exercised legislative power under 1952 . entry 36 is conditional on exercise of power under entry 42, that one could not be exercised without the other . it is further contended that the legislative power in entry 42 is a power coupled with dnty which the legislature was bound to exercise for the benefit of the person whose practy was to be paid for . the bihar legislature had legislated both under entry 36 and entry 42 . if it transpires that the provisions it has made about payment of compensation are illusory then that part of the Act would be void and as it could not have been intended by the legislature to pass the Act in any truncated form . the entire Act should be held unconstitutional . it is necessary to refer to its provisions and see on what subjects the legislature has purported to enact . section 3 provides for the constitution of a Land Commission to advise the St:ite Government on the agrarian policy . the dominant purpose of the Act is that of transference to the State of the interests of proprietors and tenure-holders in land . rnment may declare the estates or tenures mentioned therein to have passed and become vested in the State .

R. Das that the obligation to pay compensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule . riefly the origin of the power of the state on the subject of compulsory acquisition of property . the power to take property for public use has been exercised since olden times . thi, is the requirement that property shall not be taken without just compensation . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga, and others . the power of compulsory acqms1- tion is described by the term \"eminent domain\" this term seems to have been originated in 1625 by Hugo Grotius . the property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the State, so that the State or he who acts for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property . et Pacis'' says private ends must be supposed to have intended that private ends give way . the relationship between the individual's right to compensation and the sovereign's power to condemn is discussed in Thayer's cases on constitutional law . \"let's be particularly noticed upon what grounded it stands viz., . upon the natural rights of the individvid . on the otht;.r hand, the right of the State to take springs from a different source, viz., a necessity of government . the right is no mere right to pre-emption, and it has no condition of compensation annexed to it: either precedent or subsequent . the power to acquire compulsorily or of the term \"eminent domain\" is the power of the sovereign to take property for public use . without the owner's con- sent . the concept of the public use has been inextricably related to an appro- priate exercise of the power . payment of compensation, though not an essential ingredient of the connotation of the term, is an essential element of the valid exercise of such power. authority is universal m support of the amplified definition of \"eminent domain\" authority is the power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the owner's consent upon making just com pensa ti on . the question for consideration is whether this obligation to pay compensation for compulsory acquisition of property has been impliedly laid down by the constitution makers in our Constitution under legislative head in entry 36 of List II and entry 33 of List I . to my mind, our Constitutio has put in express and clear terms somewhere else in the Constitution . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . n has raised this obligation to pay compensation for the 1952 . the matter to be discovered and spelt out by learned arguments at the bar . they explicitly provided for it in article 31 (2) of the Constitution . the obligation to pay is a thing inherent in the language of ;l). tlY.: concept of acquisition and compensation are two different notions . one is founded on the sovereign power of the State to take . the other is based on the natural right of the person who is dqirived of property to be compensated for his loss . by section 299 of that statute a fetter was imposed on the power of legislation itself . the constitution, however, de- clared laws not providing for compensation . the constitution for enforce-ment 0of Mr. Das is not right in his contention that unless adequate provision is made by a law en- acted under legislative power conferred by entry 36 of List I for compensation, the law is unconstitutional . entry 36 itself does not authorize the making of such a . law without providing for compensation . dean obeidallah: exercise of legislative power under entry 36 was conditional on simultaneous exercise of power . he says there has been no valid exercise of this power under the impugned act . the two entries referred to as \"subject to\" occurring therein . no such words occur in entry 33 of the Union List . it is by force of the provisions of article 31 (2) that it be- comes mandatory to legislate . ent could make a law for com- pulsory acquisition of property for hs purposes . but a state legislative lature in this respect is in a different situation . the only purpose of the words \"subject to\" occuring in entry 36 is to indicate that legislation under entry 36 would be subject to any law made by Parliament in exercise of its legislative power under entry 42 of the C . entry 42 would have pre- ference over a State law in case of repugnancy . it was for this reason that reference was made to entry 42 in the head of legislation mentioned in the State List under entry 36 . a Parliamentary statute made in exercise of its legislative powers under entry 42 of the C'nncurrent List . it was urged that the legislative power conferred in entry 42 is conferred . the power conferred by the entry was coupled with a duty to exercise it . it was said that the legislature is bound to exercise this power for his benefit whenever it takes property under its compulsory powers . these o.bservations do not have apposite application to the case of legis- lative powers conferred by a constitution . the entries in the lists are merely legislative heads and are of an enabling character . ercise its power of legislation under entry 42, if it failed to do so . failure to make a law under entrv 42 cannot make law made under entry 36 bad . the expropriated proprietor has been deprived of his rights or remedies in respect of this matter . Article 31(4) is in these terms:- \"if any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the legislature of a State has, after it has been passed\" the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the grounds that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) . Articles 31-A and 31-B are in these terms: \"31-A. (1) . ishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any pro-visions of this Part . if such law is a law made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this Article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration the Presi- dent has received his as any local area have the same meaning as that ex-pression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in that area . the expression 'rights', in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub-proprietor, under proprietor, tenure-holder or other intermediary . the provisions contained in article 31-A, no of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule or any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or even to have become void . such Act, Regulation or provision is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any rights conferred by any provisions of this Part . Mahajan/, 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . each of the said Acts and Regulations shall, subject to the power of any competent legislature to repeal it, continue in force . the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the grounds that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2) . a strict construction has to be placed on the language of this clause, it being in the nature of a debarring pro- vision . clause (4) makes the obligation to pay compensation a condition precedent to the compulsory acquisition of property . clauses preceding the word \"unless\" are descriptive of the law . the use of the word \"such\" fully supports this interpretation . such a law must contain a provision for payment of compensation to the expropriated proprietor . the existence of a \"public purpose\" is undoubtedly an implied condition of the exercise of compulsory powers of acquisition by the State . the language of article 31(2) does A not make it a condition precedent to acquisition . the law relating to compulsory acquisition of property is not valid . the sovereign power to acquire property compulsorily is a power to buy it only for a public purpose . there is no power in the sovereign to acquire private propes . public purpose is a content of the power itself . reference in this connection may be made to Willoughby's Constitutional Law . therein it is stated . public purpose is an essential ingredient in the definition of the expression \"eminent domain\" the exercise of the power to acquire compulsorily is conditional on the existence of a public purpose . the scope of article 31 ( 4) is limited to the express provisions of the article . courts cannot examine the extent or the adequacy of the prov1S1ons of compensation contained in any law dealing with the 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . ahara;a dhiraia Sir Kameshwar Singh of . darbhanga and others . acquisition of property compulsorily for public purpose . but the barring provisions of article 31(4) lo not take away the court's power to examine whether the legislature that made the law has acted in exercise of its law making power within the legislature . new articles 31-A and 31-B merely place beyond the scope of the c;ourt any enactment dealing with compulsory acquisition of property . article 13(2) of the Constitution cannot be called in aid to impugn the validity of such legislation . :i.rticle 31 (4) is to a great extent right in his contention that the law under challenge in the matter of compensation is highly unjust or inequi- table to certain persons . compensation in some cases is purely illusory . the constitution prohibits an enquiry in a court of law into those matters . the same Constituent Assembly that provi- ded the guarantees in article 31 (2) in respect of pay- ment of compensation and provided the remedy . it is not possible for us to examine its contents on the question of quantum of compensation . the courts' hands are tied by the provisions of article 31 ( 4) . to be justiciable, the same subject- matter which is expressly barred is contained impli- citly in some other entry and therefore open to exa- mination . the material point for determination is whether the acquisition oct. the right to legislate under entry 36 postulates the existence of a public purpose . if it be not so, the law can certainly be held to be unconstitutional . shearer J.: \"we are, in my opm10n, estopped from saying that the acquisition of estates and tenures is not an acqui- sition f\" the high court ruled that there was no public purpose behind the Act . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . 1952 The state of bihar was reached in view of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31 . the Constituent Assembly considered two requirements as essential for compulsory acqumt10n . the constituent Assembly thought that protection was not reqaued under the other head . the Constituent Assembly regarded nationalization of land as it- self constituting a public purpose . das J. said: \"there is clear indication in the Constitu. tion of India that the expression 'public purpose' is to be understood in a wide and comprehensive sense\" the land reforms hill was pending at the commencement of the Constitution . it was surprising that the Constituent Assembly tried to save such legislation by means of clause (4) of article 31 . k, say that there was an implied declaration by the Constitue11t Assembly that such legislation was for a public purpose . such declaration will be given deference by the courts until it is shown to involve an impossibility . the Act was bad as it was silent on the question as to why the zamindaris were being acquired . that it only provided for the interception of rents which instead of being realized by the zami11dars would . go into the coffers -0f the Government without any benefit being derived . there are 13,35,000 land-owners and tenure-holders m Bihar . if an average family be taken to consist of four persons, five and a half million people will be ruined by this legislation . it IS pointed out that the waste lands were sufficient to meet the requirements of villagers for grazing (;attle and for pasture) the acquisition of the estates was intended to crea-ting one machine-ridden and red-tapist super-landlord by depriving a substantial portion of the public of their means of livelihood . reference in this connection was made to the decision in Hamabai Pramjee Petit v. Secretary of State for India (1) . it was observed that the phrase \"public purpose\" whatever it . the impugned Act, it was contended, did not fall within this definition of \"public purpose\" reference was also made to Vol. II of Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, at page 744 . it was urged tl1at there was nothing definite or tangible in the Act or in the views of the legisla-tures . the legislature did not know its own mind at all and on a vague notion of some future policy directed . d the acquisition of the estates can only be made for purposes of the Union or for a public purpose . it is un- •1ecessary to state in express terms in the statute itself tne precise purpose for which property can be acquired . it may be conceded that the present statute does not disclose the legis- lature's mind as to what it would ultimately do after the estates arc vested in the State Government . a land commission will advise the Government on its agranan policy . the statute • • • ,. ' • .. the Act 1s intituled a public purpose . the preamble of the Constitution says that India has been con-stituted into a Sovereign Democratic Republic . Article 39 of the Directive Principles of State Policy states as follows: \"the State shall direct its policy t!owards\" the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment . the purpose of the acquisition contemplated by the impugned Act is to clo away with the concentrat;on of big blocks of land ancl means of pro-duction in the hands of a few individuals. in other worls, the purpose behind the Act is to bring about a reform in the land distribution system of Bihar for the general benefit of the commu- nity . the legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community . the object of th1 Act is 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maliaraja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . n five and a half million people in khas have not been made subject-matter of acquisition . their homesteads, tbeir mineral wealth except mines not in operation haven't been seriously touched by the pro-visions of the Act . the phrase \"public purpose\" has to he con- strued according to the spirit of the times in which particular legislation is enacted . the acquisition of the estates has to be held to have bees . acquisition of fifty per cent was for the private purpose of the zemindars . the other 50 per cent were either for supplementing the revenues of the state or for securing means for payment of compensation . clause 4) of article 31 gives no protection against the invalidity of these clauses . learned Attorney-general contended acquisition of choses in action . \"the principle of com- pulsory acquisition of property,\" says Cooley . the principle is based on the superior claims of the whole com munity over an individual citizen . private property is wanted for public use or demanded by the public welfare . no instance is known in which it has been taken for the mere purpose of raising a revenue by sale or otherwise . the exercise of such a power is utterly destructive of individual right . willis in his Constitutional Law offers the same opm1on . an examination of this case does not disclose that any such proposition was stated therein . hat a bill to restrain the enforce-ment of a state statute regulating fire insurance rights was a valid law in the state of Kansas . it was not necessary to decide in this case whether under the compulsory acquisition power the State has the power to acquire choses in action or money, but it cannot be . 1952 The State of Bihar v.

Mahajan] the validity of this acquisition has to be decided independently of the acquisition of the estates . it stands on the same footing as other debts due to zamindars or thei . the only purpose to support this acquisition is to raise revenue to pay compensation to some of the zamindars whose estates are being taken . this purpose does not fall within any definition, however wide, of the phrase \"public purpose\" in appeal no. 299 of 1951, the arrears of Darbhanga Raj were a sum of Rs. 30,81,967 . half of this amount is payable to the Raj and the other half stands forfeited . the impugned Act is a fraud on the Cunstitution . the Act merely pretends to comply with the Constitution when it says that it provides for payment of compensation . but in effect it has produced a scheme for non-payment of compensation by shift and contrivance . TS 945 vest in the state without payment of compensation . no compensation has been made payable in respect of forests or trees . it was claimed that the object of the Act was to acquire properties of the zemindars . in case of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, zemindari would be acquired without anythig . the state would have to pay out of his own money six lakhs to the Government . the zemindari will be acquired on payment of a small sum of Rs. 14,000 only . no-thing will be payable to the zamindars out of the public exchequer . attention was drawn to the obser- vations of shearer J. in passage . to take over the great estates in the province, paying no com- pensation or the most inadequate compensation . a comparatively small minority belonging to this parti-cular class are to be expropriated without compensa-tion . 1952 The State of Bihar v.

Chairman of the Darbhanga Municipality(8) pointed out that the offer and acceptance of one rupee was a colourable attempt to obtain a title under the Land Acquisition Act without paying for the land . the ques- tion is whether they have any application to the present case . it is by no means easy to impute a dishonest motive to the legislature of a State . some of the provisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act may be . the estates of half a dozen zemindars may be expropriated . the whole enactment is a fraud on the Constitution . the state of bihar v.

I cannot possibly assent to any such construction of this entry. ds tfius: \"Principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned is to be determined\" this head of legislation seems to have been expressly mentioned in the Concurrent List . it seems that in cases of compul- sory acquisition of property compensation has to be made . ory provisions of article 31(2) require that a law authorising the taking or acquisition of propeny will be void if it does not provide for payment of compen- ation for the property acquired . the power of legisla-tion in entry 42 is for enacting the principles of deter- mining such compensation . the principles to be enacted are for determining the equivalent price of the property taken away . it may be that the determination of the equivalent may be left for ascertainment on the basis of certain uniform rul('s; 1952 The State of Bihar •• Maharaja- tlhiraja Sir Kameshwar Sin1h of Darbhan111 and others . no principles are required to be stated for non-payment of compensation . a simple statement that no compensation will be paid is quite enough to attain the object . ples __ ior determination of compensation result in its non-payment except in the Act under notice . the key words in the entry are \"compensation\" and \"given\" in this connection to the United Provinces v. atiqa Begum('), it was held that the descriptive words under the legislative head - \"collection of rents\" are wide .enough to permit k-lation in respect of remission of rents and that under item 22 of the Government of India Act, 1935, the legislative heads \"forests\" include the power to legislate with respect not only to  on the prohibition of fishing altogether, these analogies have no application to the construction of the language employed in entry 42 . the question was whether the legis- lative head \"Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" included the power to abolish it also . il made the following observations which appear at page 363 of the report .

Das that section 32 (2) of the Act was void . a two-fold attack was levelled against this prov1S1on . section 32 (2) dele- gated essential legislative power to the executive which it was incompetent to do . the matters alleged to have been delegated are these:- 1. The determination of the proportion of the cash payment to the payment by giving bonds, negotia . 'TM State of Bihar v. Maharaia­ ilhiraia Sir Kamcshu1ar Singh t'>f Darbhanga ond Others . the payment of compensation will be in these two forms . it further enacts that bonds shall be either negotiable or non-transferable . the payment, if made in bonds, will be paid in forty equal instalments . the instalments will carry interest at the rate of two and a half per cent . it has also enacted that the bonds will carry a fixed interest rate . the executive is the question of proportion in which compensation is to be paid in cash or in bonds . the legislature applied its mind to the question of the method and manner of payment of compensation . it settled its policy and the broad principles . the legislature gave the state government the power to determine matters of detail . the  executive could fix the interval of instalments and the period of redeemability of the bonds . it cannot be said in this case that any essential legislative power has been delegated to tuesday . th.at the legislature did not discharge the trust which the Constitution had reposed in it . if the rule-making authority abuses its power, the expropriat proprietor will not be without a remedy . f 1951 and in the other cases in which he appeared were the same . some of the points are covered by the arguments of Mr. P. R. Das . ation and the mode and manner of payment of such compensation was already occupied by the Land Acquisition Act . this argument really has no force, because the provisions as to asessment of compensation enacted in the Land acquisition Act only apply to acquisitions that are made by notification under that Act. 1952 The Stau of Bihar v. Maharaia­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . hiraia Sir Ka111eshwar- Singh of darbhanga and others argues that transference of estates of zamindars to the State requires registration . he says the bihar Legislature had no power to issue bonds without complying with the procedure laid down in article 293 of the Constitution . the state legislature issues bonds which are unenforceable or which it is not competent to issue . the contention can possibly be raised when it comes to trust properties . Raghav Saran was unable to point out how the Bihar Legislature had no power to acquire trust properties . he raised a novel point that the Act not being reasonable and just, the Supreme Coun had jurisdiction to declare it void on that ground . the appeals are therefore allowed except to the extent indicated above . a writ of mandamus will issue to the State Government not to give effect to the two  . no infringement of any fundamental right has been alleged therein . there was no appearance for the respondents in cases no. 18 of 1950 and 299 of 1951 . the Bihar Land Reforms Act of 1950 is not unconstitutional . the provisions contained in section 4(b) and 23(f) of the Act must be held to be void and inoperative . my learned brother has based his decision on the ground that the provision of the provision must be in effect . i:t is a colourable exercise of that power under which a thing has been done wliich is not contempleted by that entry 42 of the Legisla- tive List III in Schedule VII of the Constitution . the legislature purported to exer- cise its powers under this clause . the provision of this clause is un- constitutional as it does not disclose any public pur- pose at all . the requirement of public purpose is implicit  compulsory acquisition of property by the State or, what is called, the exercise of its power of eminent domain . 1952 The State of Bihar v.

R. Das formulates the following five principal grounds of attack against the Act . A. On a proper interpretation of articles 245 and 246 read with entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others . id Act makes no provision for the payment of just compensation . the respondents are barred from going into the question by reason of articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B . the Act is unenforceable 111 that section 32(2) provides for payment of compensation in 40 equal instalments . it delegated essential legislative functions to the executive government . formidable and it 1s with close attention in support of each Re Ground A . that article 31 (2) imposes upon a law for the compulsory acquisition of private pro- perty the obligation to provide for compensation . the impugned Act contraves or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the provision for compensation made in article 31(2) . it is also provided for in other parts of the Constitution and the impugi:ed Accuracy . t can well be challenged on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the provisions of those other parts of the Constitution . the argument is developed in the following way: the power to acquire private property is, in essence, a power to compel the owner to sell his property when the public interest requires it . in some of the English statutes for compulsory acquisition of lands and hereditaments, the word \"purchase\" was used to denote acquisition . there can be no sale without a price, there cannot be com- pulsory acquisition of private property without an pro- vision for paym . just compensation is a principle of natural equity re- cognised by all temperate and civilized governments . that the right to compensation is an incident to the exercise of the power of eminent domain and that the one is so inseparably connected with the other . the obli- gation to pay compensation is inseparable from and implicit in the power of acquisition . it follows, therefore, that the obligation to pay . compensation is \"a necessary con- comitant to taking\" gation flows ftom the mere use of the word \"acquisi- tion\" in entry 36 in List II, as in entry 33 in List I . con- notes a compound concept, namely, the concept of a power of taking on jus . the word \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II and entry 33 in List I does not by itself imply the obligation to pay just compensation . peggy drexler: the words \"subject to the provisions of entry 42 of List III\" actually bring in that obligation . er to make law with respect to matters specified therein is \"subject to\" the exercise of legislative power under entry 42 in List III . enlarge the content of the last mentioned  entry 36 in I)st II . entry 42 in List III should, by itself, be construed as conferring a power coupled with a duty . the law-making power under entry 33 in List I or entry 36 in List II is at all exercised . if the word \"acquisition\" does not imply the obligation to provide for compensation . n the principle laid down by the House of Lords in /ulus v. Lord Bishop of Oxford(') and adopted by this Court in Chief Controlling Revenue Autho­ rity . it is urged that the Bihar Legislature having purported to exercise its power to make a law for compulsory acquisition of property under entry 36 m ( 1) L.R. 5 App. Cas. 214 . e for determining what may, in the eye of the law, be regarded as just compensation at all, the Act is ultra vires and void . the arguments thus deve- loped by Mr. P. R. Das undoubtedly have the merit of attractive ingenuity and apparent cogency . the contention is that it is essentially a legslation for land reforms and alteration of land tenures . the Act eliminates the interests of all zernindars and in-termediate tenure-holders so that the State and the actual tiller of the soil may be brought into direct relationship . m and others('), Thakur /agannath Baksh Singh v. the united provinces(2) and Megh Raj vs. Allah Rakhia and others(8) in support of the proposition that each entry in the list must be construed as widely as possible so as to in-clude all ancillary matters . the lien of reasoning found favour with Shearer J. but was rejected by Reuben J. and entry 36 in List II will have to be held as wholly redundant . the former should be read as a legislative (1) [1940] F.C.R. 110 . 1952 The Stat• of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . das/. 972 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] category or head . a la for acquisition of the arrears of rent cannot be said to be a law relating to the collection of rent within the meaning of that entry 18 . the arguments of the learned Attorney-General are based on entry 36 in List II . the obligation to pay compensation is con- comitant to, accompanies, the power of compulsory taking of private property by the State cannot be disputed . the first important question is whether this obligation is implicit in the term \"acquisi- tion\" as used in entry 36 in List II . Lord Dunedin pointed out that the power of acquisition was, in its origin, derived from the prerogative of the Crown . the pay-ment of compensation was originally a matter of negotiation and bargain between the Crown and the subject, but came to be determined later on by statutes of local application . ng party to every statute must, in effect, be regarded as having consented to the exercise of its prerogative being made subject to payment of compen- sation regulated by statutes . in the united states of America the power of eminent domain was not originally conferred on .. the Fifth amendment gave a constitutional recog- nition to the right of eminent domain . this indicates that the power of acquisition and the obligation to exercise that right by the State . pay compensation are two separate and distinct concepts . the second follows the first . it follows that the expression \"acquisition\" does not import any obligation to pay . the obligation to pay compensation may be introduced as a part of the legislative power itself, in which case it becomes a composite power . if this obli- gation were not implicit in entry 36 in List II then where else, it is asked . in section 31 (XXXI) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitu-tion Act the acquisition of property on just terms has been made a head or category of legislative power of the parliament . there the power is not to make a law for the acquisition . of property sim- pliciter but is to make an acqui.sition law which connotes that the legis- lative power itself is circu . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kamshwar Singh of darbhangt and others . 1952 The state of bihar requires that the obligation to pay compensation for the acquisition of property must be paid . under article 246 parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to the compulsory acquisition of private property . it must depend on the provisions of the particular constitution under consideration . \"acquisition or requisitioning of property for the pur- poses of the Union,\" we find . tures have exclusive power to make laws with respect, inter alia, to matters specified in entry 36 in List II . both Parliament and the State Legislatures may make laws relating to matters set forth in entry 42 . no pro- perty can be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes unless the law provides for compensation for the property . e power of Parliament or of the State Legis- latures is made \"subject to the provi- sions of this Constitution\" the power of making a law for acquisition of property in article 246 read with entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II . the obligation of such law to provide for compensation in article 31 (2) . entry 33 in List I and entry 36 in List II are mere heads of legislative power . it is not necessary to treat the obligation to pay compensation as implicit in or as a part or parcel of these legislative heads themselves . maxim expressum f acit cessare tacit um is a principle of logic and common sense . the express provision in article 31 (2) that a law of acquisition, in order to be valid, must provide for compensation, will necessarily exclude all suggestion of an implied obligation to provide . for compensation sought to be impo.i;.ted into the meaning of the word \"acquisitio\" in the face of the express provision of article 31 (2) there remains no room £or reading any such impli- cation in the legislative heads . Mr. P. R. Das suggests that if the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in the word \"acquisition\" itself as used in entry 36 in List II that obligation is atracted . l.n entry 33 in List I and this pan of Mr. P. R. Das's argument would lead to this anomalous result that the obligation to provide for compensation is made a part of the legislative power under entry 36 in List II by virtue of its last few words . the framers 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others . das reads the words \"subject to\" as meaning \"conditional upon\" entry 42 in List III exercised legislative power under entry 42 . exercise of legislative power conditional upon fulfilling obligation to provide for compensation . i agree with S. K. Das J. that the words \"subject to\" mean \"but not\" entry 42 in List III is not within the content of entry 36 in List II . it may well be argued that, in view of article 246, Parliament will not be competent to maintain law . dant caution that entry 42 in List III has been excluded from the content of entry 36 . in List II by the words \"subject to\" et cetera and Parliament may, therefore, freely make a law . this consideration was not material in connection with entry 33 . if the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in the word \"acquisition\" in entry 36 in List II it is the duty of the State Legisla-ture to make a law with respect to matJters speci- fied in entry . 42 in List III on the principles that . confers a power on the Legislature for the protection of the . interest of persons; whose property is compulsunly acquired, such power must, therefore, be regarded as coupled with a duty to exer- cise it . Article 246 does not make it obli- gatory for Parliament or the State Legislatures to make a law under any of the entries in the Seventh . Schedule . Entry 42 in List III does not impoe any duty upon Parliament or state Legislatures . entry 42 in List III constitutes a legislative head under which Parliament or the State Legislatures may make a law so as to give effect to the obligation expressly imposed on them by article 31 (2) . in view of the clear provision of that article it is wholly unnecessar . the obligation to provide for compensation is not included in the content of the legislative power u_nder entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III . clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and article 31-A will be made further clear when we come to look closely . article 31 ( 4) protects a law of the description mentioned therein against t- tion . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . das/. 978 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] does not fix the law . the question at once arises as to whether there is any legislative entry in List II under which a law for acquisition or taking possession of property without compensation can be made by a State Legislature . under article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken the case of a law otf acquisition made by a state which also come within article 31(4) . if that entry by it- self or read with entry 42 in List III has any impli- cation as suggested . property made under entry 36 in List II without a provision for compensation wiJll is beyond the legis- lative compentency of the State Legislatures . there can, therefore, be no point in making a prOIVision in article 31(4) for protecting, against article 31(2) . cir- cumstance unmiistakabRy establishes thait entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III, ha.s not any such implication as is imputed to it . article 31(5) (b) (ii) protects the provi-sions of any law which the State may hereafter make for the promotion of public health . he law wh'ich is therefore sought to be protected must also involve acquisition of property without any provision . a law of this kind must necessarily be made by a State Legis- lature, if at all, under entry 36 in List II . motion of health or the prevention of danger to life or property involving the acquisition of property without a provision for compensation, which is what is sought to be protected from article 31 (2), can never be made . the obligation to provide for compensa-tion is implicit 'in entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List III' . le to attempt to get over this anomaly by suggesting that clauses ( 4) and (5) (ii) of article 31 have been inserted in the Constitution ex abundanti cautela . if Mr. P. R. Das were correct in his submission, no amount of caution was necessary for protecting a law that, ex hypothesi, cannot be made at all . 31-A postulates a valid law made by a competent legislature within the ambit of its legislative powers . if a state Legislature must pro- vide for compensation then a law made conformably with this supposed requirement of that entry will require no protection ar all agalnst article 31 (2) . in my opinion clauses ( 4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A clearly negative Mr. P. R. Das's proposition . in my judgment, the major premise in the arguments under the first head is unsound . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . ed in question on the ground that it contravenes or is 'inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause (2) of a 'de 31, that is to say, that it does not provide for compensation . article 31 (4) and the added articles debar the respondents from questioning the validity of the Act on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any rights conferred by clause (2) of article 31. articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B expressly seek to prevent a challenge to the validity of the Act . if, as contended by Mr. P. R. Das, the self-identity provision be found elsewhere in the syria . if two construc-tions are possible, the Court should adopt that . if a \"prorvision\" is possible, it must be regarded as having been covered by article 31 . article 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B protects the Act against everi legislative in- competency, if any . he says the respondents are not entitled to call the Act in question on the ground that it does not provide for everi in- competence . the argument that the .Act is unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that it has not laid down any principle for determining compensation as required by entry 42 in List III . the provision for compensation is wholly illusory . the compensation is to be calculated at a sliding scale 0£ rates . to the amount thus determined is added a moiety of the accumulated rent etc. and the compensation for the mines and minerals as determined under section 25 . he Act does prescribe some principles for determin-ing the compensation payable to the proprietor c.r tenure-holder . the deduction of 5 to 20% of the gross assets as and by way of cost of management is quite arbitrary . 1952 The State •f Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanz11 and others . nts, to my minct, do not, on close scrutiny, amount to saying tha:: the Act does not lay down any principle for determin-ing the compensation . the real implication of these arguments is that the principles are not good enough in that they do .not produce fair compensation. it is clear that the Act has fixed the scale of deducion under this head and under the head of works of benefit according to the capacity of the proprietor or tenure- holder to bear it . a landlord .is expected to spenciously . there is nothing wrong, when calculating the net income of a landlord, to deduct something which the landlords should and some of them often do, in prac-tice, spend under this head . a calculation of the net income on the basis of the principles laid down in the Act works to reduce the gross income to a very small net income . the gross annual income of the barbhanga estate is about Rs. 47,85,069 . the net income computed according to the principles laid down in the Act comes to about Rs. 2,96,484 or say Rs. 3  lacs and the compensation payable to the Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga will be only rupees 9 lacs . it has also been shown that at least in one case, e.g., iu the case of the Raja of Purnea the compensation calculated according to if a principle has been laid down in the Act, then the pro-visions of entry 42 in List III are amply satisfied and no question of legislative incompetency can arise . the principle laid down does not produce what may be called just compensation . aga1nst the provisions of article 31 (2) but certainly not against entry 42 in List III and in view of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B the Act . a breach of the provisions of entry 42 in List III constitutes a violation of the provi-sions of article 31 (2) which clearly and emphatically re- quires the law to either fix the compensation or lay down the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be given . the act cannot, for reasons already stated, be questioned . n view of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B . it should be remembered that article 31 ( 4) by reason of the words \"notwithstanding 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others. the act cannot be called in question on the ground of legislative incompetence of the Bihar Legislature to enact it under entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in List III . nt to repel the first ground of attack levelled against the Act by Mr. P. R. Das . it is said that section 3 of the Act does not contemplate or authorise the acquisition of arrears of rent at all . the arrears of rent including all that are mentioned in clause (b) of section 4 are also to vest in and be recoverable by the State . this vesting of the rent in the state necessarily implies the transfer of the rights of the proprietors or tenure-holders . it is argued that the power of eminent domain cannot be exercised with respect to money and choses in action besides certain other un- usual forms of property . this passage is founded on certain earlier decisions of the American Courts . isville & N. R. Co.(1) cited therein that the modern view is that the right of eminent domain can be exercised on choses in action . in any case we are to consider whether arrears of rent are \"property\" in the sense m which that expression ts used in our Constitution . nable claim against the tenants is undoubtedly a species of \"pro- perty\" it is urged that the Act makes no provision for payment of compensation for taking this item . the arrears of rent are directed to be added to the compen- sation . ts added m the process of the assessment of the compensation . this argument arises only because a moiety js paid back, as it were, m the same com . if compensation for money were made, the same argument would not have been available . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others . das/. 1952 The state of bihar could not be said to be a JUSt compensation . that argument, in view of articles 31(4), 31-A and 31-B, would , , have been that the land so given, not being equivalent in value to the money compuls if only a moiety of the amount of arrears is returned the obvious complaint will be that the return of 50,000 rupees is not fair or adequate compensation for taking away Rs. 1,00,000 . the argument completely overlooks the argument . the arrears of rent are not really cash in the till of the proprietor or tenure-holder . it will have to be realised, possibly by suit followed by execution proceedings in- volving time and money in costs . the state takes the risk of realising or not realising the rent . fifty per cent of the arrears is in a lump added to the compensation . if it be inadequate, the grievance will be that no principle has been laid down in the Act . ' Das is that even if the Court does not accept the argu- ment as to the necessity for providing for compensation >' the respondents are, by reason of the provisions of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B, debarred from questioning the validity of the Act on the ground that it does not provide for compen- s.i.tion . that the existence of a public pur- pose is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition . the words \"for public purposes\" do occur in article 31 (2) but it is said that there is a distinction between a \"provision\" and an assumption . the only \"pro- vision\" of article 31 (2) is that the law autho- rising the taking of possession or the acquisition of property for a public purpose must provide for compensation . y that cannot be made a ground of attack on the Act by reason of articles 31 ( 4), 31-A and 31-B of the Constitution . this argument has found favour with Reuben J. and S. K. Das J. The latter learned Judge . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga . the learned judge then refers to the following passage in the judgment of my learned brother . one limitation imposed upon the acquisition of taking possession of private property is that such taking away must be for public purpose . the other condition is that no property can be taken unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains a provision for payment of compensation in the manner lai . it is significant that Mukherjea J. recognises that article 31 (2) \"prescribes\" a two-fold limit . a clause which is \"prescribed\" by the articles must be a provision . a provision of the clause must include an implied as well as an express prov.1S1on . the requirement of a public purpme as an essential prerequisite to compulsory acquisition is, if anything, essentially a disposition of tha.t clause and an integral part of it . articles included in tl1e Constitution under the heading \"Funda- mental rights\" it confers fundamental right in so far as it protects private property from State action . the article protects the owner from being deprived of his property save by authority of law . clause (1) is a negative language . clause (1) will read:- \"Any person may be deprived of his property by authority of law\" the only limitation put upon the State action is the requirement that the authority . of law is the prerequisite for the exercise of its power to deprive a person . clause (2) is worded 'm negative language in order to emphasise the fundamental right contained therein . the enunciation of this fundamental right requires a statement of the ambit and scope of the State action . it is necessary to specify the limitations on the state act . clause (2) of the article, in its positive form, omitting words unnecessary for our present purpose, w111l read as follows . \"Any property, ... . or such acquisition, may be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law auhorising the taking of such possession if the law provide for compensation for the property taken ........................... the clause makes it clear at once and beyond any shadow of doubt that there are three limitations imposed upon the power of the State, namely: (1) that the taking of possession or acquisition must be for a public purpose . the law must provide for compensation 1952 The State of Bihar v.

Das/. 990 SUPREME COURT REPORTS . the existence of a public pur- pose as a prerequisite to the exercise of the power of compulsory acquisition is an essential part of the \"provisions\" of clause (2) . it will lead us to the un- tenable conclusion that parliament will be free under its residuary powers under article 248 and entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for ac- quiring private property without the power . the existence of a public purpose as a condition precedent to the exercise of exercise of the power of the constitution could never have been the intention of the framers of our Constitution . the power of compulsory acquisition is then, as I hold, an infringement of such a provision cannot be put forward as a ground for questioning the validity of the Act . the necessity for the existence of a public purpose is implicit in entry 36 in List II . entry 36 in List II by virtue of the words \"subject to\" etc. appears at the end of that entry and his conclusion is that in the absence of a public purpose the Bihar Legislature had no legislative com- petency under those two entries to enact the impug- ned Act . entry 36 covers any purpose except the purpose of the Union . the argument based on the words \"subject to\" etc. at the end of entry 36 in List II is not well-founded . the alleged requirement of a public purpose under entry 42 in List III cannot be said to be incorporated in entry 33 in List I . it would, there-fore, follow that whereas under entry 36 in List II the Legislature can only make a law for compulisory acquisition of property . entry 33 in Llst I does not attract entry 42 in List III . the words \"acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the Union or of a State or for any other public purpose\" in that entry are merely words descriptive of the preceding word \"property\" entry 42 in List III, as a legisla- tive head, is the principles for the determination of compensation and the form and manner of giv'ing the compensation for property which is described as having been acquired . that entry cannot possibly be regarded as an legislative head for acquisition of property and much less is the purpose or province of that entry . the 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others. Das/. entry 36 in List II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III will apply to this contention mutatis mutandis . the pro-visions of article 31 (2) will exclude the implication sought to be read into entry 36 . article 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B contain the words \"notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" will protect the Act from such implied prov!S!on . the question remains whether there is a validity of the Act on the grounds of the legislative incompetency arising out of the absence of a public purpose . the question still remains if there i can challenge the validity of the act . it is to be noted that there is no recital of any public purpose . it is conceded that this circumstance is not fatal to the validity of the Act . however, it is claimed that the Legislature had no public purpose in its view . it is not disputed that as a result of this enactment a very large sum of money now payable by the tenants as and by way of current rent and arrears of rent to their respective landlords will be intercepted by the state . it is urged, on the authority of certain passages in Cooley's Constitu- tional Lirri1tations, 8th Edn., Vol. II, p. ln Bihar the recorded pro-prietors are about 13,35,919 in number . nearly five and a half million people will be ruined as a result of this legislation . ctual tillers of the soil will derive no benefit whatever therefrom . they will continue to pay rJ.eir rent to the tate which, they will find, is no better than a ruthless machine unsusceptible to any humane feeling . the state cannot take private property to-day and say that it will think of the public purpose at its leisure . we have been referred to some american authorities for ascertaining the meaning and implication of \"public use\" 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir  Kame sh war Singh of Darbhanga and others . das f. 994 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] that the notion as to what is a public use is rapidly changing in America . no satisfactory definition of term \"public use\" has ever been achieved by the Courts . one theory limits the application to \"employment\"-\"occupation\" judicial attempts to des- cribe subjects to which expression would apply . a little investi- gation will show that any definition attempted would exclude subjects that properly should be included in, and include subjects that must be excluded from, the operation of the words \"public use\" the more limited application of the principle appears in the earlier cases, and the more liberal agplication has been rendered necessary . in the nature of the case, modern cond11tions and the increasing inter-dependence of the different human factors make it necessary for the Government to touch upon and limit individual activities at more points than formerly . the use\":-following observations to vol. XX . the meaning of e term is flxible and ,  is not confined to what may constitute a public use at any given time, but in general it may be said to cover a use affecting the public generally . courts have gone so far in the direction of a liberal construction as to hold that \"public use\" is synonymous with \"public benefit'', \"public utility\", ' or \"public advantage\" it is sought to use the power of eminent domain to pro- mote such public benefit, etc. the learned author proceeds to discuss the more restricted meaning given to that expression . it should be borne in mind that the Judicial Committee in that case had to consider the meaning of the words \"public purposes\" occurring in a lease of the 19th century . se definition of the expression \"public purpose\" was content to quote with approval . \"general definitions are, I think, rather to be avoided where the avoidance is possible,\" it says . the concept of \"public purpose\" has been rapidly changing in all countries of the world . no hard and fast definition was laid down . 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaia­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga . ja dhiraja sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and-Others . he says it is the presence of this element in an object or aim . dividual must be regarded as a public purpose . our old and narrower notions as to the scope of the general interest of the community are fast changing and widening . the emphasis is unmistakably shifting from the individual to the community . our Constitution has not ignored the individual but has endeavoured to harmonise the individual interest with the paramount interest of the community . our Constimtion protects the freedom of the citizen by article 19(1) (a) to ( e) and (g) but empowers the State, even while those freedoms last, to impose reasonable resrictions on t . the moment even this regulated freedom of the individual becomes incompatible wi,th . the state is given power by article 21 to 'leprive the individual of his life and personal liberty in accordance with procedure established by law' m the interest of the general public (1) [1950] S.C.R. 88. 1 . the state may, under article 31, deprive the owner of his property by authority of law subject to payment of compensation . a fresh outlook places the general interest of the community above the interes of the individual pervades our Constitution . the preamble proclaims the solemn resolve of the people of tills country to secure justice, social, economic and political, and of opportunism . the ideal we have set before us in article 38 is to evolve a state which must constantly strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and making as effec- tively as it may be a social order in which social, economic and political justice shall inform all the in-stitutions of the national life . rticle 39 the state is enjoined to direct its policy . the words \"public purposes\" u.sied in article 23(2) indicate that the Constitution uses them in a very large sense . law must keep pace with the realities of the social and political evolution of the cow1try as reflected in the Constitution . if the State is to give effect to these avowed purposes of our Constitution we must regard as a public purpose all that will be calculated to promote the welfare of the people as envisaged in these directive principles of State policy . Das/. 998 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] the light of this new outlook what, I ask, is the pur- pose of the State in adopting measure for the acquisi-tion of the zamindaries and the interests of the inter- mediaries . this State ownership or control over land is a necessary preliminary step towards the implementationa-tion of the directive principles of State policy . it cannot be overlooked that the Directive principles set forth in Part IV of Constitution are not merely the policy of any partic  cular political party but are intended to be principles fixed by the Constitution . the impugned Act sets up a Land Com- mission to advise the state government . it also sets up an abolition of the land tenure system which has been found to be archaic and non-conducive to the general interest of the community . this very bihar Act was before the Constituent Assembly when it passed article 31 ( 4) and again when it took the trouble of amending the constitution for saving this very Act . it is impossible to say that there is no public purpose to support the Act. cir- cumstances also clearly indicate that the Constituent Assembly regarded this Act as well supported by a .public purpose . we must not read a measure imple-menting our mid-tweet . ntieth century Constitution through spectacles tinted with early nineteenth century notions as to the sanctity or inviolability of individual rights . the impugned Act was enacted for a public purpose . Mr. P. R. Das then puts up a narrow argument . t authorises the taking of the arrears of rent or the taking away of 4 to 12! per cent. of the gross assets on the specious pka that the landlords must be supposed to spend that percentage of their gross income on works of benefit to the rayats of the estates . this argument is unsound for more reasons than one . ari entirely wrong approach to pick out an item out of a scheme of land reforms . n of article 31 (2), its absence, if any, in relation to rent arrears cannot be made a ground of attack against the Act . the proper approach is to take the &cheme as a whole and than examine whether the entire scheme of acqms1t10n is for a public purpose . agrarian reforms do not improve or affect the conditions of the tillers of the soil . das/. 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ tlhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhan ga anti Others . edward mccarthy: i do not see why the taking over of the arrears of rent, in the context of the acquisition obama . the acquisition of zamindaries and tenures is a scheme for bringing about agrarian reforms and amelio rating the conditions of the tenants . the aim is, inter alia, to bring the tillers of the soil in direct con tact with the States so as to free them from the clutches of rapacious landlords . rents fall into arrears after tenants liquidate part of the old rents . rs with rents find it difficult to pay the current rent after liquidating a part . the total amount of Raiyati rent payable by the various tenants in the different circles of the Darbhanga Estate alone will exceed rupees three lacs. arrears of rent due by the -tenure-holders to their immediate superior tenure- holder or to the zamindar can safely be taken that the bulk, if not all, of the actual rayats or tiiJ!ers of the soil are habitually and perpetually . the rent of their holdings on account of financial stringency resulting from their chronic inexperience . zamindaries and tenures only are acquired under the Act leaving the zamindars and the tenure holders free to realise the huge arrears of rent due by the actual cultivating tenants by legal process . if the actual tenants and tenure holders only are given the right, title and S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1001 interest therein and the sale of the holdings . the majority of the actual tillers of the soil wiH then become landless labourers . the entire scheme of land reforms envisaged in the Act will be rendered nugatory . landlords in arears will have better treatment and a more reasonable accommodation, in the matter of the liquidation of the huge rent arrears . the state will act under the guidance of the Land Com- mission than from expropriated landlords whose sole surviving interest in their erstwhile tenants will only be to realise as much of the rent . the same re- marks apply to the acquisition of decrees for arrears of rent . the public purpose of ameliorating the conditions of the cultivating raya may well have induced the Legislature to treat the arrars and decrees differently from other ordinary moveable properties . the second main ground of attack levelled by Mr. P. R. Das against the Act must be rejected . if I could agree with Mr. Das that these provisions are bad for want of a public purpose, I am not at all sure that I would not have found it extremely difficult to resist his further argument . 1952 T lze State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja;a Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga and others . das J. 1002 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1952] not have been very easy to presume that if the Bihar Legislature had known that these provisions of the Act might be held bad it would nevertheless have passed the other parts in that form . the scheme of agrarian reform was not considered by the Bihar Legislature . but it was deemed to be at all capa-ble of easy implementation by the state without the acquisition of the arrears of rent . john avlon: no par:t of the Act is bad for a public purpose . judicial decisions relied on by learned counsel on both sides . the Act pretends to be in conformity with the Constitution, but in effect, constitutes a defiance of it . the Act, he urges, purports to pay back fifty per cent. of the arrears of rent as compensa-tion but in reality confiscates the other 50 per cent . under the guise of deducting 4 to 12f per cent of the gross income the state is appropriating a large sum under tllli head . the argument will be found to resolve itself into an attack on the legislative competency of the Bihar Legislature to pass this Act . it is the absence of a provision S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1003 for just and adequate compensation that mak the Act bad . ve power under entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III requires the making of such a prov1S1on . the failure to comply with this consti- tutional condition may be overt or it may be covert . the charge of fraud on the Constitution is, on ultimate analysis, a picturesque and epigrammatic way of expres- sing the idea of non-compliance with the terms of the 'Constitution' the constitution says that the arrears of rent must not be acquired . there is no neces- sity for any covert attempt to do what is not prohibit- ed . in a scheme of land eforms such as is envisaged the acquisition of the zamindaries and the tenures . is it called a fraud on the Constitution to take such property ? does the Constitution prohibit the acquisition of such property? is it fraud ? 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . ch are at present non-income-yielding but whii;h have very rich 1952 The state of bihar . the Act is really attacked on the ground that it fails to do what is required by the Constitution to do, namely, to provide for compensation for the acquisition of the properties and is, therefore, ultra vires . this, to my mind, is the same argument as to the absence of just compensation in a different form . the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in entry 36 List II by itself or read with entry 42 in Lisit: III . there can be no question as to legislative incompetency for any alleged non-compliance with any supposed requirement said to be im- plicit . if the principles so laid down in the Act do not produce any compensation, such absence of compensation may be a contravention of article 31 (2) . in view of articles 31 (4), 31-A and 31-B it cannot be made a ground of attack on the Act . such ground is formulated in a different but attractive la . nguage, namely, as a fraud on the Constitution, must also be rejected . if I took a different view I would still have the same difficulty as to the inseverability of the different provisions of the Act . Mr. P. R. Das's last main point is that the Act has delegated essential legislative functions to the Effective Government . Article 31 (2) requires that the law authorising the taking poss,ession or the acquisi-tion of land should provide for compens- tion . entry 42 in List III talks of principles on which compensation is to be determined . the Constitution has left to Parliament or the State Legislature the duty of specifying the principle on which, and the form and m- pensation . the bihar Legislature has simply provided that the amount of compensation shall be paid i:n cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds . the bonds shall be either negotiable or non-negotiably and non-transferable and be payable in forty equal instalments . it has failed to lay down any decisive provision but has left the matter to the State Government to decide . the matter of the propriety and legality of the delegation of legis- lative power has recently been considered by this Court in In re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912 etc.(1). Das J. 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhangtr and others . section 32 clearly indicates that the Legislature has applied its mind to the problem . it has laid down the principle that the compensation may be paid in cash or in bonds or pardy in cash and partly in bonds . e bonds may be either negotiable or non-negotiably and non-transferable . the executive has left it to the Execu-tive to determine the proportion in which the compensation shall be payable in cash and in bonds . the Executive Government would be more familiar with the Legislature itself . Mr. P. R. Das's contention that this amounts to a delegation of an essential legislative function within the meaning of the decision of my learned brothers . state for which he appears, the Central Act must apply to Ramgarh until the notification is withdrawn . the impugned Act cannot apply for determining the compensation, for the field is already occupied by the central Act of 1894 . the doctrine of occupied field cannot apply to acquisitions under the Bihar Act . in my opi- nion there is no substance in this contention . for reasons stated above, I allow these appeals . article 31 of our Constitution provides \"No per- son shall be deprived of his property save by autho- rity of law\" there are three modes of deprivation: destruc-tion, acquisition and requisition . in the case of \"acquisition\", there is an element of permanency, and in the cases of \"requisition\" there is a element of temporariness, except for this distinction . both modes stand on the same footing, as regards the rights of the state vis-a-vis the private citizens. entry 33 in List I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution speaks of acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the Union . the law of eminent domain has recognized the right of Government compulsorily to acquire private pro- perties of individuals for a public purpose . it is a principle of universal law that the acquisi-tion can only be on payment of just compensation . it is an affirmance of a great doctrine esta- blished by the common law for the protection of private pr- sation . operty is founded in natural equity, and is laid down by jurists as a principle of universal law . the government possessed an uncontrollable power over the private fortune of every citizen, he writes . he says it would be vain to speak of such an administration, when all property is subject to the will . the payment of compensation is an essential ele-ment of the valid exercise of the power to take . Lord Dunedin spoke of the payment as a necessary concomitant to the tak-ing of property . property shall be confiscated for the benefit of others, or of the public, without any (1) [1920] A.C. p. 508. (2) [1893] 1 Ch. pp. 16 & 28 . '' . is principle is embodied in article 31 (2) of our Constitution in these terms . \"o prop_erty, i:iovable or immovaJ:le, including any mterest m, or m any company ownmg, any com- mercial or industrial undertaking, shall be taken pos- session of or acquired for public purposes . we shall not here trouble ourselves with sub-clauses (3) and (4) of the article and with articles 31-A and 31-B . the argument of Shri P. R. Das that the payment of compensation is a concomitant obligation to the compulsory acquisition of properties by the State . ascertairU,ng the scope or extent or ambit of the legislation and the rights and the duties created thereby, we must . examine the legislation itsdf or must have resort to general and well-recognized principles of law of jurisprudence. 1952 The State of Bihar v. Maharaja­ dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . t or hidden when property is acquired for a public purpose . entry 42 means nothing more than a power conferred on the Legislature for achieving this end . the power is conferred but there is no duty cast to provide for compensation . the learned Attorney-General contended in dealing with entry 42 that legislation under entry 42 can also lay down principles that would lead to the non-pay- ment of any compensation . he cited Atiqa Begum's case as an authority in his case . th'e terms of entry 42 enable the legislature to lay down the principles . if the principles are so formu lated as to result in non-payment altogether, then the legislature would be evading the law not only covertly but flagrantly . there is nothing in Atiqa Begum's case that supports the argument . it was there hefd' that under the head \"payment of rent\" there could be legislation providing for remission of rent . \"form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given\" the principles determining compensation must lead to the giving or payment of some :01npensation . to negate compensation altogether by the enunciation of principles . article 31 ( 4) is the first stumbling block in his way . it provides:- \"if any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution has, after it has been passed by such Legislature, beert reserved for the consideration of the President\" the bill was pending at the com- mencement of the Constitution in the legislature of the state . it was reserved for the consideration of the president and received his assent . the bar that it shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes clause (2) . sub-clause (4) postulates an exception and the right to challenge the validity of the Act . no compensation has been provided for or that the compensation is really illusory or inadequate ts taken away . Article 31-A, sub-clause (1) is in these terms . no law providing for the 10!0 S.C. India/7! 1952 The State of Bihat v.

Maharaja dhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of darbhanga and others . \"arrears of rent\" and \"cost of works of benefit to the raiyats\" dealt with in section 4 clause (b) and section 23 clause (f) of the Act have to be considered . the taking over of particular items does not seem to have a remote connection with any question of land reform . the rents in ques- tion were not realised before the passing of the Act . the consequences of vesting of estates must have some relation to the tenures themselves . legislation stating that as it is necessary to eliminate rent collectors and farmers of revenue and to appor-tion and distribute land on an equitable basis . all moneys which the pro-prietors had collected as and by way of rent from their estates for three years prior to the commence-ment of the Act shall vest in and be payable to the State . a public purpose in taking the moneys is conspicuous by its absence . the arrears of rent stand on no better footing . 1015' cannot be appropriatel by the State unler the power 1952 of eminent domain for the mere purpose of adding to The State of its revenues . taxation is the recognised mode to secure Bihar this end . bhanga Sub-clause (1) of section 24 provides that 50 per cent of rent arrears of rents shall be added to the amount of compensation . one of two things (a) either the other 50\"/o is taken without payment of any compensation, which is confiscation virtually or (b) 50% . willis say!l in his Constitu- tional Law at page 816:-\"there are certain rather unusual forms of private property which can- not thus be taken . these are corpses, money, choses in action, property used by the government in its governmental capacity, property to be used for a mere substituted oct.

Nicols' work on \"Eminent Domain\" does not disagree with this view . he says money can be taken by eminent domain and it has been held or intimated . objection is not based on an implied inherent limitation upon the power of government . but upon the difficulty of effecting a taking of money that would be of any service to the public without violating the Con- stitution . compensation must be paid in money, and, if not in advance, the seizure of money without compensation . the 'learned Attorney-General sought to justify this acquisition on the ground that it was a compulsory taking of choses in action . a forced sale or loan-however it might be justified by dire necessity would not be a constitutional exercise of the power of eminent domain' in the former case, 166 U.S. 685; 41 L.

Appeals by special leave from judgment and order dated 27th July 1955 . lpahani employees' union wanchoo j.  26 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1960(1)] 1959. May 6. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by. WANCHOO J.-These are connected appeals by special leave against the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in an industrial matter . o. 4'.74 is by the employees of the company represented by Ispahani Employees' Union (hereinafter called the workmen) they will be disposed of by one judgment . there was a dispute between the company and its workmen . r the workmen are entitled to puja bonus for 1953, and (2) if they are entit.led to receive from the company any benefits for the period of service rendered by them under Messrs. llf. M. Ispahani Ltd. M. M. Ispahani Ltd. trans­ferred their registered head office from Calcutta to Chittagong, now in Pakistan . the company was incorporated on September 15, 1947 and took over the good-will and trading rights of Messrs. the company continued to pay puja bonus at the rate of one month's wages from 1948 up to 1952 . as no bonus was paid in 1953, a dispute arose between the company and the workmen . the Industrial Tribunal held that it had not been established that puja bonus had been paid at the uniform rate of one month's wages for a sufficiently long time and for unbroken period . the industrial Tribunal rejected the claim for puja bouns for 1953 . award led to two appeals, one by the company on the question of benefits due under the law during their service under the company . the labour Appellate Tribunal allowed both the appeals . puja bonus had become a term of employment and the workmen were therefore entitled to bonus at the rate of one month's wages for the year 1953 . it held that there was termination of employment when Messrs. M. Ispahani migrated to Pakistan and the employment of the workingmen by the company was fresh employment . both the company and workmen applied for special leave to appeal against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal insofar as it was against them . the applications were granted and that is how the matter has come up before us . the Appellate Tribunal had no jurisdiction to 1.>pahni interfered with the finding of the Industrial Tribunal as Employm Umon it was a finding of fact . puja bonus was claimed as a matter of right payable by the employer at a special season of the year, namely, at the time of the annual Durga Puja . it was held in that case that this right rested on an agreement between the employees . the cireumstances were laid down in that case as material for inferring an implied agreement . the circumstances in which payment was made should be tu oxdude that it was paid out of bounty . te Tribunal pointed out that it was not possible to lay clown in tcrnrn wlmt to justify the inference of impliel agreement . the fact of payment in a year of loss would he an impor­ tant factor in excluding the hypothesis that the payment was out of bounty . r959 was laid down that even if payment was not at a Ispahani Ltd., uniform rate throughout the period, the implied agree could be inferred . it would be for the tribunal to decide what was the reasonable amount to be paid as puja bonus . the claim for puja bonus in Bengal is based on either of two grounds . it may be implied agreement between employers and employees creating a term of e-mail . mployment for payment of puja bonus may be payable as a customary bonus . in the present case we are concerned with the first cate- gory . it was this kind of bonus which was considered by the Appellate Tribunal . the 'rribunal had no jurisdic­ tion to interfere with the finding of the Industrial Tribunal that begin a question of fact' the first question can be easily disposed of . re of opinion that the decision whether there is an implied term of employment is a mixed question of fact and law and not a pure ques­ tion of fact . this is similar to the decision on a question whether a custom has been (1) i950 L.L.J. 1247 (2) 1952 L.A.C. 370 30 SUPREME COURT REPORTS . ppellate Tribunal will therefore have jurisdiction to consider this matter . the next question is whether in law the decision of the Appellate Tribunal drawing the inference of an implied term of employment in this case is correct . the workmen always used to get puja bonus at the rate of one month's wages . this was asserted in their written statement and the company did not deny it in its reply . puja bonus was paid even in the years in which the company suffered loss . it was found that it had been paying bonus ever since it came into exis­ tence from 1948 to 1952 . the length of the period depends on the circumstances of each case and what may be a short period not justifying an implied term of employment in one case may be long enough in another . the only other question that remains is whether it had been paid for a sufficiently long period . Appellate Tribunal agrees that the circumstances justify the inference of an implied term of employment for pay­ment of puja bonus at the rate of one month's wages every year . appeal of the company must there­fore fail . it is true that the company practically took over the business of Messrs. M. Ispahani Ltd. but the question arose of retrenching those employees who were not willing to go to Chittagong in view of the expected partition of India . the company, when it came into existence in September 1947, agreed to employ those employees . employees apparently agreed to the termination of their services with the company . they obtained settlement of their claims for provident fund, and also received all arrears of salary from them . ned the provident fund of the company afresh . the Appellate Tribunal has dismissed both the appeals and in con­ sequence order the parties to bear their own costs of this Court ."}
